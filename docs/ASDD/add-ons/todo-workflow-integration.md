# TODO Workflow Integration for ASDD

## Overview

The TODO Workflow Integration extends ASDD methodology to systematically handle granular work items that emerge during development phases. While ASDD focuses on progressive elaboration at the phase/level scale, real development work generates many smaller TODO items that require structured handling to prevent information loss and maintain project coherence.

## Problem Statement

During ASDD development, several types of TODO items emerge:

1. **Artifact TODOs**: Next-steps reports and transition documents contain work items requiring further elaboration
2. **Implementation TODOs**: Code and design work reveals additional tasks not captured in original planning
3. **Discovery TODOs**: Research and validation activities uncover new requirements or constraints
4. **Integration TODOs**: Component and system integration reveals coordination needs

Without structured handling, these TODOs either:
- Get lost in informal tracking systems
- Remain buried in documents where they're forgotten
- Create ad-hoc work that bypasses ASDD's collaborative and context-preservation benefits
- Lead to scope creep and uncontrolled complexity growth

## Solution Approach

The TODO Workflow Integration provides five structured commands that extend ASDD's collaborative principles to granular work management:

### Core Commands

1. **`/extract-todo-context`** - Extract TODOs from ASDD artifacts with full source traceability
2. **`/generate-todo-context`** - Create contexts for newly discovered TODOs
3. **`/decompose-todo`** - Break complex TODOs into manageable atomic tasks
4. **`/work-on-todo`** - Execute atomic TODOs with appropriate collaboration checkpoints
5. **`/asdd-todo-sync`** - Integrate TODO results back into ASDD contexts and complete lifecycle

### Design Principles

**Context Preservation**: Every TODO maintains traceability to its source and relationship to ASDD phases, preventing information fragmentation.

**Collaborative Execution**: TODOs inherit ASDD's collaboration framework, with checkpoints for user input at key decision points.

**Scope Management**: Clear boundaries prevent TODO work from expanding uncontrollably and affecting broader project scope.

**Integration Lifecycle**: All TODO work eventually integrates back into ASDD contexts, maintaining coherent project knowledge.

## When to Use TODO Workflow vs. Simple Task Tracking

### Use TODO Workflow for:

- **Multi-step work items** requiring 3+ distinct activities or decisions
- **Cross-cutting concerns** that affect multiple ASDD levels or components  
- **Research tasks** where approach uncertainty requires investigation
- **Architectural decisions** embedded within implementation work
- **Integration challenges** requiring coordination across system boundaries
- **Quality assurance tasks** requiring systematic validation approaches
- **Work items with stakeholder input needs** at multiple decision points

### Use Simple Task Tracking for:

- **Single-action items** (fix typo, add comment, run command)
- **Well-defined implementation tasks** with clear approach and scope
- **Routine maintenance** following established patterns
- **Documentation updates** for existing, stable features
- **Simple bug fixes** with obvious root cause and solution
- **Configuration changes** following documented procedures

### Complexity Indicators for TODO Workflow:

- Task description includes words like "evaluate," "determine," "design," "research"
- Multiple viable approaches exist requiring trade-off analysis
- Dependencies on external decisions or unclear requirements
- Potential impact on existing architecture or design decisions
- Need for user collaboration at multiple decision points
- Uncertainty about implementation approach or tooling choices

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Extracting from ASDD Artifacts

**Scenario**: User reviews a Level 1 to Level 2 transition report and finds "Thematic evaluation criteria clearly defined" needs elaboration.

```bash
# Extract the TODO with source context
/extract-todo-context docs/transitions/level-1-to-level-2-next-steps.md "Thematic evaluation criteria clearly defined"

# System creates: context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/todo-context.yml
```

**AI Response**: Creates structured context with source traceability, scope boundaries, and relationship to current ASDD phase. Assesses whether immediate work or decomposition is needed.

**User Decision Point**: Review context scope and decide if decomposition is needed or if TODO is ready for direct execution.

```bash
# If decomposition needed
/decompose-todo context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/todo-context.yml

# Creates multiple atomic subtasks:
# - context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/decomposition/eval-rubric/
# - context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/decomposition/scoring-framework/
# - context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/decomposition/saturation-assessment/
```

**Collaboration Checkpoint**: AI presents decomposition options (by functional area, by stakeholder, by implementation phase) and confirms approach with user.

```bash
# Work on atomic subtask
/work-on-todo context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/decomposition/eval-rubric/todo-context.yml
```

**Execution with Checkpoints**: AI pauses for user input when facing undefined constraints, algorithm choices, or architectural decisions.

```bash
# Integrate results back into ASDD contexts
/asdd-todo-sync context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria
```

**Integration**: AI updates affected ASDD level contexts with insights from TODO work, archives valuable artifacts, and cleans up temporary files.

### Example 2: Newly Discovered TODO

**Scenario**: During implementation, user realizes "Missing discussion on coding standards" needs to be addressed.

```bash
# Generate context for net-new TODO
/generate-todo-context "Missing discussion on coding standards"

# System creates: context/todo/coding-standards-discussion/todo-context.yml
```

**AI Response**: Creates context and assesses whether this should be immediately synced to existing ASDD contexts or requires dedicated work.

**User Decision Point**: Decide if this is urgent enough to handle immediately or can be deferred and integrated into appropriate ASDD level.

```bash
# If deferring, sync to appropriate context immediately
/asdd-todo-sync context/todo/coding-standards-discussion
```

**Integration**: AI identifies that this affects Level 3 (Implementation Specifics) and updates the context with this missing requirement, then cleans up the TODO context.

## Context File Organization

### Directory Structure

```
context/todo/{todo-name}/
├── todo-context.yml              # Primary context file
├── source-references.yml         # Source traceability metadata
├── decomposition/                # Decomposition artifacts (if needed)
│   ├── decomposition-plan.yml    # Strategy and rationale
│   ├── {subtask-1}/
│   │   └── todo-context.yml      # Atomic subtask context
│   └── {subtask-2}/
│       └── todo-context.yml      # Atomic subtask context
└── execution/                    # Execution artifacts
    ├── execution-log.yml         # Process documentation
    ├── decisions-made.yml        # Key choices and rationale
    ├── lessons-learned.yml       # Insights for future work
    └── deliverables/             # Actual work products
```

### Context File Templates

TODO contexts follow YAML structure similar to ASDD contexts, including:

- **TODO Identity**: Name, description, source traceability, urgency/priority
- **ASDD Relationship**: Which phases affected, dependencies, integration targets
- **Work Scope**: Deliverables, success criteria, constraints, assumptions
- **Collaboration Needs**: Stakeholders, decision points, checkpoint frequency
- **Decomposition Readiness**: Atomicity assessment, breakdown indicators

## Integration with ASDD Methodology

### Phase Relationship Mapping

TODO work maintains explicit relationships to ASDD phases:

- **Level 0 Impact**: TODOs affecting fundamental assumptions or user needs
- **Level 1 Impact**: TODOs affecting technical approach or solution strategy
- **Level 2 Impact**: TODOs affecting component boundaries or system structure
- **Level 3 Impact**: TODOs affecting implementation specifics or design patterns
- **Level 4 Impact**: TODOs affecting actual implementation or operational concerns
- **Cross-Phase Impact**: TODOs affecting multiple levels or project-wide concerns

### Backward Feedback Handling

TODO work often reveals issues affecting previous ASDD phases:

- **Constraint Discovery**: Implementation reveals new technical or business constraints
- **Assumption Invalidation**: Work shows previous assumptions were incorrect
- **Interface Issues**: Component integration reveals boundary problems
- **Approach Limitations**: Implementation invalidates Level 1 approach decisions

The `/asdd-todo-sync` command handles backward feedback by updating affected ASDD contexts with discovered constraints, revised decisions, and lessons learned.

### Context Preservation

TODO workflow maintains ASDD's context preservation principles:

- **Decision Traceability**: All TODO decisions include rationale and alternatives considered
- **Source Relationships**: TODOs maintain links to originating ASDD artifacts
- **Impact Documentation**: Changes to ASDD contexts document their TODO work origins
- **Lesson Integration**: Insights from TODO work integrate into project knowledge base

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Collaboration Checkpoints

TODO workflow includes structured collaboration points:

- **Scope Confirmation**: Before beginning work, confirm boundaries and expectations
- **Approach Selection**: Present options for algorithm, architecture, or implementation choices
- **Constraint Clarification**: Pause when encountering undefined requirements or limitations
- **Integration Strategy**: Confirm how TODO results should integrate with broader work

### Validation Requirements

TODO deliverables must meet quality criteria before integration:

- **Success Criteria Met**: Deliverable satisfies originally defined success conditions
- **Integration Readiness**: Results are structured for smooth integration with ASDD contexts
- **Decision Documentation**: All significant choices include rationale and alternatives
- **Lesson Capture**: Insights and patterns are documented for future reference

## Benefits and Outcomes
