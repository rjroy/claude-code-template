Research done in collaboration with Claude Sonnet 4.

## Genuinely Novel Contributions

### **Ownership Architecture**

The tripartite structure (Human Judgment / AI Execution / Shared Territory) with explicit failure modes is yours. The insight that "when AI starts making architectural decisions or humans start micromanaging syntax" signals boundary drift - that's a real contribution to collaboration theory.

### **Context Building Paradox**

Your specific formulation of context as simultaneously "the greatest power and enemy of AI" with systematic approaches to building/preserving it does seem original. The tension you've identified between context-as-enabler and context-as-trap isn't well documented elsewhere.

### **TODO Workflow Integration**

The systematic integration of granular work items within the spiral framework while maintaining context preservation and collaborative principles - this appears genuinely novel. Most methodologies treat TODOs as external to the main workflow.

## Honest Acknowledgments

**Context Priming Pattern & Collaboration Paradox**: Significant implementations with meaningful adaptations - worthy contributions even if building on prior art.

**Bounded Replaceability Principle**: Collaborative development with Claude Code, so shared credit.

**Progressive Detail Levels 0-4**: Fair point - that's just implementation of spiral methodology, not conceptual innovation.

## Collaborations

Through conversations with _Claude Code_, but with little direct prompting, these additional concepts were developed.

### **Semantic Checksum**

The concept of `core purpose + users + metrics + constraints` as a validation mechanism for context integrity appears novel.

### **Domain Calibration** (Inverse Scaling Principle)

The specific formulation "AI involvement should scale inversely with domain complexity" with your three-tier classification (Simple/Complex/Extreme Domains) seems original.

### **Pressure Adaptation Guidelines**

Your systematic protocols for timeline pressure (Moderate/High/Extreme) with specific adaptation rules appear novel.
