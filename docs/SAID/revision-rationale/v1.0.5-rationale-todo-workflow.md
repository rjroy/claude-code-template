# ASDD v1.0.5 Revision Rationale: TODO Workflow Integration

## What Broke

**Core Issue**: ASDD methodology effectively handled phase-level work but lacked systematic handling for granular TODO items that emerge during real development work.

**Specific Problems in v1.0.4**:
- Next-steps reports contained actionable items with no structured processing mechanism
- Granular work items were handled outside ASDD contexts, breaking decision traceability
- Lack of structured TODO handling led to uncontrolled complexity growth
- Important implementation decisions bypassed ASDD's collaborative checkpoints
- No systematic way to incorporate insights from granular work back into ASDD contexts

**User Impact**: Teams completed ASDD phases successfully but struggled with granular follow-up work, reverting to informal task management that lost ASDD's structured approach benefits.

## What Changed

### Structured TODO Context Management
- Added `/extract-todo-context` command to extract TODOs from ASDD artifacts with source traceability
- Added `/generate-todo-context` command for newly discovered TODOs
- Created comprehensive TODO context file templates with YAML structure
- Implemented subdirectory organization: `context/todo/{name}/` with decomposition and execution subdirectories

**Why**: Every TODO maintains explicit relationship to ASDD phases and source artifacts, preventing context fragmentation while enabling independent work planning.

### Collaborative TODO Execution
- Added `/decompose-todo` command for breaking complex TODOs into atomic tasks
- Added `/work-on-todo` command with built-in collaboration checkpoints
- Integrated ASDD's collaboration framework (Question Before Acting, Present Options, Explain Reasoning, Pause for Input)
- Defined common decision points for research, design, implementation, and integration work

**Why**: TODO work inherits ASDD's collaborative decision-making approach, ensuring quality and stakeholder involvement even at granular work levels.

### Systematic Integration and Lifecycle Management
- Added `/said-todo-sync` command to integrate TODO results into ASDD contexts
- Implemented backward feedback handling for discoveries that affect previous phases
- Created archival system for valuable TODO artifacts before cleanup
- Established context update templates for different types of TODO insights

**Why**: All TODO work eventually integrates back into ASDD contexts, maintaining unified project knowledge while preventing temporary artifact accumulation.

### Scope Boundary Definition
- Documented clear criteria for when to use TODO workflow vs. simple task tracking
- Defined complexity indicators and multi-step work identification
- Created usage guidelines with specific examples and anti-patterns
- Established integration decision trees for different TODO types

**Why**: Clear boundaries prevent TODO workflow overuse while ensuring systematic handling for work that genuinely benefits from structured approach.

## Evidence It Works

**Before**:
```bash
# User finds TODO in next-steps report
# No structured way to handle it
# Creates informal task in external system
# Work proceeds without collaboration checkpoints
# Results may or may not integrate back into ASDD contexts
# Knowledge and decisions get lost
```

**After**:
```bash
# Extract TODO with full context
/extract-todo-context docs/transitions/level-1-to-level-2-next-steps.md "Thematic evaluation criteria"

# Decompose if complex
/decompose-todo context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/todo-context.yml

# Execute with collaboration
/work-on-todo context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/decomposition/eval-rubric/todo-context.yml

# Integrate results and cleanup
/said-todo-sync context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria
```

**Key Success**: TODOs have structured path from discovery through integration with full source traceability and collaborative decision-making.

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Risk**: TODO workflow could become bureaucratic overhead for simple tasks → **Mitigation**: Clear scope boundaries documentation and complexity indicators prevent overuse for simple work
- **Risk**: Context file proliferation could create management complexity → **Mitigation**: Systematic cleanup through `/said-todo-sync` and archival strategy prevents accumulation
- **Risk**: Teams might bypass TODO workflow for urgent work → **Mitigation**: Emergency handling documented with cleanup protocols; flexibility built into collaboration checkpoints
- **Risk**: Additional commands increase cognitive load for ASDD adoption → **Mitigation**: TODO workflow positioned as optional extension; teams can adopt ASDD core first then add TODO handling

## Bottom Line

Version 1.0.5 completes ASDD methodology's coverage of real development work by providing systematic handling for granular TODO items. The TODO Workflow Integration maintains ASDD's core principles—context preservation, collaborative decision-making, and quality assurance—while extending them to the detailed implementation work that prevents the methodology gap between planning and execution.
