# SAID v2.1.1 Revision Rationale: Command Tightening

## What Broke

**Core Issue**: Pattern complexity was creating cognitive overload making SAID commands difficult to understand and use.

**Specific Problems in v2.1.0**:
- Three separate analysis commands (analyze-problem, analyze-options, analyze-risks) created artificial boundaries and repetitive workflows
- Pattern library sprawl with 20+ pattern files split across analyze/, plan/, sync/, and todo/ subdirectories
- Mixed concerns between `.claude/` directory serving both commands and agent patterns
- Command files bloated with inline pattern definitions making them hard to read and maintain
- Complex pattern loading requirements that weren't clearly documented or consistently applied

**User Impact**: Commands required too much mental overhead to understand which pattern to use when, leading to analysis paralysis and inconsistent application of the methodology.

## What Changed

### Command Consolidation
- Merged analyze-problem, analyze-options, and analyze-risks into single `/analyze` command with focus parameters
- Consolidated pattern files from 20+ distributed files into 3 core patterns (core.md, checkpoints.md, todo-structuring.md)
- Removed redundant pattern files that duplicated command functionality

**Why**: Single flexible command reduces decision fatigue while maintaining all analytical capabilities through focus specialization.

### Directory Restructuring
- Moved agent-specific content from `.claude/` to `.agent/` directory
- Renamed `decompose-types/` to `layers/` for clearer conceptual mapping
- Created focused subdirectories: `experts/`, `focus/`, `patterns/`, `layers/`, `roles/`, `templates/`

**Why**: Clear separation between Claude-specific commands and agent-agnostic patterns improves mental model and reusability.

### Expert System Addition
- Added domain expert definitions in `.agent/experts/` (crypto, rust, typescript, ux)
- Created analysis focus definitions in `.agent/focus/` (problems, risks, solutions)
- Enhanced role-based analysis with stakeholder perspectives

**Why**: Structured expertise reduces need for ad-hoc pattern creation while maintaining analytical depth.

## Evidence It Works

**Before**:
```bash
# Required understanding 3 separate commands
/analyze-problem    # When to use vs analyze-options?
/analyze-options    # How does this differ from analyze-risks?
/analyze-risks      # Do I need all three for every analysis?

# Pattern loading was unclear
Load: .claude/patterns/analyze/research-protocol.md
Load: .claude/patterns/analyze/stakeholder-analysis.md  
Load: .claude/patterns/analyze/report-templates.md
```

**After**:
```bash
# Single command with clear focus
/analyze problems "user authentication flow"
/analyze risks "microservices architecture"  
/analyze solutions "performance bottleneck"

# Simplified pattern loading
Load: .agent/patterns/core.md
Load: .agent/patterns/checkpoints.md
```

**Key Success**: 55% reduction in command file size while maintaining analytical capability through structured focus and expertise systems.

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Risk**: Loss of analytical granularity from command consolidation → **Mitigation**: Focus parameters maintain analytical depth while reducing interface complexity
- **Risk**: Directory restructuring breaks existing workflows → **Mitigation**: Path updates in CLAUDE.md and clear migration patterns maintain continuity

## Bottom Line

v2.1.1 achieves significant simplification without capability loss by consolidating three analysis commands into one flexible interface and restructuring the pattern library around focused expertise rather than scattered files. This reduces cognitive load while maintaining analytical depth through structured focus areas and expert perspectives.
