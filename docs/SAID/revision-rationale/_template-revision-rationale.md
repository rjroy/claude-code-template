## Template Usage Notes

### When to Use This Template

Create a revision rationale report when:
- **Systematic Issues**: Multiple related problems identified across methodology
- **Philosophical Changes**: Fundamental assumptions or approaches are modified
- **Workflow Gaps**: Missing pieces in the development process are discovered
- **User Experience Problems**: Expected workflows don't function as intended
- **Performance Issues**: Methodology creates bottlenecks or inefficiencies

### When NOT to Use This Template

Skip this template for:
- **Minor Updates**: Simple typo fixes, formatting improvements
- **Single Feature Additions**: Adding one new command or template
- **Documentation Clarification**: Explaining existing concepts better
- **Cosmetic Changes**: Visual improvements without functional impact

### Key Principles for Good Rationale Reports

1. **Problem-First**: Start with what wasn't working, not what you built
2. **Evidence-Based**: Use specific examples and measurable impacts
3. **User-Centered**: Focus on how changes affect people using the methodology
4. **Honest Assessment**: Include risks and potential downsides
5. **Forward-Looking**: Consider how changes position methodology for future evolution

### Report Categories

**Discovery Reports**: What was learned about methodology effectiveness
- Focus: Insights gained from usage patterns
- Structure: Analysis → Findings → Implications

**Failure Analysis**: What went wrong and why
- Focus: Root cause analysis of systematic problems
- Structure: Failure → Cause → Solution

**Enhancement Reports**: What was improved and why
- Focus: Specific improvements and their rationale
- Structure: Gap → Solution → Validation

**Philosophy Evolution**: How core principles changed
- Focus: Fundamental assumption changes
- Structure: Previous → New → Justification

### Success Criteria for Rationale Reports

A good rationale report should:
- **Explain the Why**: Clear connection between problem and solution
- **Provide Evidence**: Specific examples and measurable impacts
- **Enable Learning**: Others can understand and apply insights
- **Support Evolution**: Future versions can build on documented reasoning
- **Maintain Honesty**: Acknowledge limitations and risks

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Solution-First Thinking**: Don't start with what you built
- **Vague Problems**: Be specific about what wasn't working
- **Missing Evidence**: Include concrete examples and impacts
- **Ignoring Risks**: Acknowledge potential downsides
- **Static Perspective**: Consider how changes affect future evolution
