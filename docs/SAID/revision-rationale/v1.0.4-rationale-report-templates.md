# ASDD v1.0.4 Revision Rationale: Report Template Enhancement

## What Broke

**Core Issue**: Existing report templates were treated as compliance exercises rather than tools for driving project decisions and actions.

**Specific Problems in v1.0.3**:
- Templates encouraged checkbox completion over meaningful communication
- Critical next steps were hidden in middle sections of reports
- Single format didn't serve different stakeholder needs effectively
- Templates couldn't evolve based on actual usage patterns
- Emphasis on "what happened" rather than "what now"

**User Impact**: Report writers spent excessive time on documentation sections that readers ignored, with critical actions buried in formal structures that quickly became outdated.

## What Changed

### Action-First Design
- Actions Required section leads both executive and phase reports
- Every metric connects to a potential action with clear "so what" factor
- Risks paired with specific mitigations and ownership
- Clear ownership for all actions with names and dates

**Why**: Reports should help people make decisions and take action, not just record what happened.

### Stakeholder-Specific Views
- Collapsible sections for different audiences (technical/executive/operational)
- Progressive disclosure with details available but not mandatory
- "What You Need to Know First" section leads phase reports
- Multiple usage modes (minimum/standard/comprehensive)

**Why**: Different stakeholders need different levels of detail at different times.

### Self-Evolving Templates
- Explicit guidance for template evolution based on usage
- Feedback loops track report effectiveness
- "Skip patterns" for different scenarios with encouragement to delete unused sections
- Report cards track velocity and prediction accuracy

**Why**: Templates should improve through use rather than remaining static documents.

## Evidence It Works

**Before**:
```markdown
# Traditional Report Flow
1. Write comprehensive documentation
2. Bury actions in middle sections
3. Create one-size-fits-all format
4. Hope readers find relevant information
5. Reports become outdated quickly
```

**After**:
```markdown
# Action-First Report Flow
1. Lead with Actions Required section
2. Provide stakeholder-specific views
3. Include feedback loops for effectiveness
4. Enable template evolution based on usage
5. Focus on driving decisions and progress
```

**Key Success**: Actions Required section leads reports with clear ownership and "so what" factors throughout.

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Risk**: Templates become too complex with multiple views → **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure with minimum viable options for time pressure
- **Risk**: Teams skip template evolution guidance → **Mitigation**: Built-in prompts and feedback loops make evolution natural part of usage
- **Risk**: Action-first design creates shallow documentation → **Mitigation**: Details remain available through progressive disclosure; depth when needed
- **Risk**: Teams resist change from familiar formats → **Mitigation**: Clear before/after examples and demonstrated time savings

## Bottom Line

This revision transforms reports from documentation exercises into decision-driving tools through action-first design, stakeholder-specific views, and built-in evolution mechanisms. Reports now help people make decisions and take action, not just record what happened.
