# SAID v2.1.2 Revision Rationale: Documentation Alignment

## What Broke

**Core Issue**: Documentation referenced outdated command patterns that no longer existed, causing confusion about which commands were available.

**Specific Problems in v2.1.1**:
- Role definitions referenced obsolete `/analyze-options` and `/analyze-risks` commands instead of unified `/analyze`
- Template files still showed old command patterns in technology decision examples
- Missing `/prime-context` command definition despite being referenced in main documentation
- Simple typo ("Gaol" instead of "Goal") in solutions focus definition
- Inconsistent whitespace formatting in role README

**User Impact**: Users following documentation examples would encounter command not found errors, breaking their workflow and undermining confidence in the methodology.

## What Changed

### Command Reference Consolidation
- Updated `.agent/roles/README.md` to reference the correct `/analyze` command with focus parameters
- Fixed examples to show proper syntax: `/analyze solutions "..." --roles=...` instead of deprecated patterns
- Corrected `.agent/templates/project-context-init.md` to use `/analyze solutions` in technology decision placeholders

**Why**: Command consolidation happened in v2.1.1 but documentation wasn't fully updated, creating a disconnect between implementation and guidance.

### Missing Command Definition Added
- Added complete `/prime-context` command definition in `.claude/commands/prime-context.md`
- Included full process documentation with context extraction, summary generation, and CLAUDE.md updating
- Provided proper template structure and quality standards

**Why**: The command was implemented and referenced but lacked formal definition, making it unclear how to use effectively.

### Documentation Quality Improvements
- Fixed typo in `.agent/focus/solutions.md` (Gaol → Goal)
- Corrected whitespace formatting inconsistencies
- Updated main CLAUDE.md to reflect current command structure and remove outdated workflow examples

**Why**: Small errors accumulate to create impression of incomplete or untested methodology.

## Evidence It Works

**Before**:
```bash
/analyze-options "Mobile app backend" --roles=architect,developer
# Command not found error
```

**After**:
```bash
/analyze solutions "Mobile app backend" --roles=architect,developer
# Works as documented
```

**Key Success**: All documentation examples now match implemented command structure, eliminating the command-not-found experience that broke user trust.

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Risk**: Users with bookmarked old documentation pages might still reference outdated patterns → **Mitigation**: Clear migration path in getting-started guide shows correct syntax
- **Risk**: Command definitions might drift from implementation again → **Mitigation**: Documentation alignment is now part of revision process checklist

## Bottom Line

This revision eliminates the disconnect between documentation and implementation that was undermining user confidence. All examples now work as documented, and the missing `/prime-context` definition provides clarity on a key workflow command.

## Template Usage

**Use this template for**:
- Systematic methodology problems
- Fundamental approach changes
- Missing workflow pieces
- User experience failures

**Skip for**:
- Typo fixes
- Single command additions
- Documentation clarification
- Cosmetic changes

**Key principles**:
- Problem first, solution second
- Concrete examples, not abstract descriptions
- Honest about risks and limitations
- Focus on user impact
