# ASDD → SAID: Naming Evolution Summary

## Context

User was developing a new AI collaboration methodology called "AI Spec-Driven Development (ASDD)" but felt uncertain about the identifier/name. The methodology is based on TDD/BDD concepts but specifically designed for sustained AI collaboration on large projects.

## Core Methodology Characteristics

- **100% focused on AI collaboration** - not just using AI as a tool, but true partnership
- **Spiral/progressive elaboration approach** - flexible detail levels with built-in feedback loops
- **Domain-calibrated collaboration** - AI involvement scales with complexity
- **Context preservation across phases** - maintains project coherence
- **Pressure-adaptive protocols** - philosophy that bends without breaking
- **Bounded replaceability principle** - components designed for informed replacement decisions

## Naming Exploration Process

**Initial Problem with "ASDD":**

- Clunky to pronounce
- Didn't roll off the tongue like TDD/BDD
- Didn't capture the full richness of the methodology

**Early Suggestions Explored:**

- Spec-First AI Development (SFAD)
- AI-Guided Development (AGD)
- Collaborative Spec Development (CSD)
- Various "CAD" variants (rejected - already Computer-Aided Design since 1960s)

**Key Breakthrough Questions:**

1. What's the single most important differentiator?
2. What's the "aha moment" for developers?
3. Is this specifically for AI collaboration? (Answer: Yes, 100%)

**Target Question to Answer:**

> "I want to work with AI and I want to follow a repeatable strategy to make a large project, not just a script to do one simple thing. What should I do?"

## Final Decision: **Spiral AI Development (SAID)**

**Why SAID Works:**

- ✅ Clear AI focus (answers the core question)
- ✅ Distinguishes from one-off scripts (spiral implies sustained work)
- ✅ Pronounceable and memorable
- ✅ Connects to established spiral development but in new AI context
- ✅ Captures the progressive elaboration and return-to-earlier-levels approach
- ✅ Room for ecosystem growth ("SAID for Complex Domains", etc.)
- ✅ Positions correctly in landscape - not adapted TDD/BDD, but ground-up AI methodology

**Runner-up:** AI Partnership Methodology (APM) - but spiral component proved important for distinguishing the approach.

## Outcome

Methodology renamed from ASDD to **Spiral AI Development (SAID)** - a name that clearly communicates purpose, approach, and differentiates from existing methodologies while being practical for everyday use.
