# ASDD v1.0.3 Revision Rationale: Decomposition Workflow Enhancement

## What Broke

**Core Issue**: Individual commands lacked the structured artifact generation and consumption chain necessary for effective component-to-feature-to-implementation breakdown.

**Specific Problems in v1.0.2**:
- Commands didn't produce structured YAML files for consumption by subsequent levels
- Level 2 defined components but provided no mechanism to decompose them into features
- Commands used generic `<in-file>` parameters instead of specific artifact consumption
- Expected workflow `/level-3-specifics level-2-similarity.yml` was impossible

**User Impact**: The original vision to "break down a problem into smaller components" became "solve this thing" - too generic and lacking systematic decomposition.

## What Changed

### Structured Artifact Generation
- Created YAML templates for levels 2-4 (component, feature, implementation artifacts)
- External artifact references rather than embedded content
- YAML files reference separate API specs, data models, interface definitions
- Enables independent evolution of technical specifications

**Why**: Preserves appropriate formats while maintaining traceability across decomposition levels.

### Command Input/Output Specification
- Level 2: Takes approach docs, outputs one `level-2-{component-name}.yml` per component
- Level 3: Takes component artifact, outputs multiple `level-3-{component}-{feature}.yml`
- Level 4: Takes feature artifact, outputs `level-4-{component}-{feature}-implementation.yml`
- Added artifact generation process with collaboration checkpoints

**Why**: Creates systematic component-to-feature-to-implementation pipeline with structured handoffs.

### Enhanced Context Management
- Updated `/said-context-sync` to handle YAML artifact integration
- Implementation discoveries affecting previous level decisions
- Constraint propagation and conflict resolution
- Backwards feedback process with explicit steps

**Why**: Critical decisions and discoveries must flow backwards to maintain consistency.

### GitHub Flow Clarification
- Human creates branch, reviews results, requests commits/PRs
- Human + AI collaborate on analysis and implementation
- AI only performs git operations when explicitly requested

**Why**: Clear role boundaries prevent automation assumptions and maintain human control.

## Evidence It Works

**Before**:
```bash
/level-3-specifics <generic-file>  # Unclear input/output
```

**After**:
```bash
/level-2-structure approach-docs/
# → Generates: level-2-similarity.yml, level-2-authentication.yml

/level-3-specifics level-2-similarity.yml
# → Generates: level-3-similarity-search.yml, level-3-similarity-matching.yml

/level-4-implementation level-3-similarity-search.yml
# → Generates: level-4-similarity-search-implementation.yml
```

**Key Success**: Expected workflow `/level-3-specifics level-2-similarity.yml` now functional with systematic decomposition pipeline.

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Risk**: Artifact complexity overwhelming users → **Mitigation**: Templates provide clear structure with comprehensive documentation
- **Risk**: External reference management burden → **Mitigation**: YAML artifacts serve as index to external files, reducing cognitive load
- **Risk**: Backwards feedback creating cascade effects → **Mitigation**: Context sync includes conflict resolution and impact assessment protocols
- **Risk**: Teams preferring simpler, unstructured approaches → **Mitigation**: Artifacts provide value through traceability and decision preservation

## Bottom Line

Version 1.0.3 fixes the broken decomposition workflow by implementing structured artifacts and clear command I/O specifications. The originally envisioned workflow `/level-3-specifics level-2-similarity.yml` now works as expected, enabling systematic component-to-feature-to-implementation breakdown with maintained traceability.
