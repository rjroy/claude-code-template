## Command Guidelines

### [ROLE NAME] Expert

**Focus**: [What this level/phase focuses on achieving]
**Success criteria**: [What must be accomplished to consider this level complete]
**Failure mode alert**: [Primary failure patterns to watch for at this level]
**Transition requirement**: [What validation is needed before advancing to next level]
**Output**: [Primary artifacts and deliverables produced]

### AI Collaboration Framework Reminder

1. **Question Before Acting** - Always ask clarifying questions before major implementation decisions
2. **Present Options** - Provide pros/cons rather than choosing for the user
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share the "why" behind technical recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Honor collaboration checkpoints at key decision points
5. **Calibrate Confidence** - AI involvement scales inversely with domain complexity

### [LEVEL/PHASE] Specific Guidelines

**[Level/Phase Name] Protocol**

**1. [Primary Activity 1]**
- [Key questions to ask]
- [What to focus on]
- [What to avoid or defer]

**2. [Primary Activity 2]**
- [Specific techniques or approaches]
- [Quality criteria to apply]
- [Validation methods]

**3. [Primary Activity 3]**
- [Implementation details]
- [Integration considerations]
- [Risk assessment approaches]

**4. [Primary Activity 4]**
- [Documentation requirements]
- [Context preservation needs]
- [Decision tracking]

**5. [Primary Activity 5]**
- [Testing or validation approach]
- [Success metrics]
- [Failure handling]

### [Validation/Spike Type] Requirement

**[Level] [Validation Type] (Required)**:
```yaml
[validation_name]:
  purpose: "[What this validation proves]"
  duration: "[Time limit for validation]"
  scope: "[What should be included/excluded]"
  deliverables:
    - "[Expected output 1]"
    - "[Expected output 2]"
    - "[Expected output 3]"
    - "[Expected output 4]"
```

**[Validation] Focus Areas**:
- [Area 1 to validate]
- [Area 2 to validate]
- [Area 3 to validate]
- [Area 4 to validate]

### Context Manifest Updates

Update the context manifest with [level] decisions:

```yaml
[level]_context:
  # Inherit from [Previous Level]
  [decision_category]:
    [decision_items]:
      - [item]: "[Description]"
        [attribute]: "[Value]"
        [attribute2]: "[Value]"
        
  [validation_results]:
    [validation_item]:
      - [item]: "[What was validated]"
        [result]: "[Outcome]"
        [evidence]: "[Supporting data]"
        
  [discovered_items]:
    - [item]: "[What was discovered]"
      [impact]: "[Effect on project]"
      [response]: "[How we'll handle this]"
```

### Domain-Calibrated AI Involvement

**Simple Domain**:
- AI can [what AI can do in simple domains]
- Human [what human focuses on]
- [Trust level and verification approach]

**Complex Domain**:
- AI [limited AI role]
- Human [expanded human role]
- [Increased validation requirements]

**Extreme Domain**:
- AI [minimal AI role]
- Human [full human ownership]
- [Maximum validation and review]

### Standard Pressure-Testing Protocol for [Level/Phase]

**1. [Context-Specific Reality Check]**
- "[Domain-specific validation question]"
- "[Failure mode specific to this level]"
- "[What assumptions need testing]"

**2. [Integration/Boundary Assessment]**
- "[How this connects to other work]"
- "[Interface and dependency questions]"
- "[Handoff complexity evaluation]"

**3. [Implementation/Feasibility Validation]**
- "[Team capability questions]"
- "[Resource and timeline reality]"
- "[Technical complexity assessment]"

**4. [Scope and Constraint Testing]**
- "[Boundary definition questions]"
- "[Scope creep prevention]"
- "[Constraint validation]"

**5. [Risk and Failure Mode Analysis]**
- "[Where this could break down]"
- "[What would force redesign]"
- "[Fallback and recovery options]"

### Advancement Criteria

**Can proceed to [Next Level] when:**
- [Specific completion criteria 1]
- [Specific completion criteria 2]
- [Specific completion criteria 3]
- [Validation requirements met]

**Must defer advancement when:**
- [Blocking conditions 1]
- [Blocking conditions 2]
- [Unresolved risks or gaps]

**Backward Navigation Triggers**:
- [Condition that invalidates current level]
- [Discovery that conflicts with previous levels]
- [Fundamental assumption proven wrong]

### Integration Points

- **Spiral Model**: [How this level fits into spiral iteration]
- **Context Preservation**: [What context this level maintains/creates]
- **Domain Calibration**: [How domain complexity affects this level]
- **Progressive Elaboration**: [What can be deferred from this level]
- **Accountability Matrix**: [Who owns decisions at this level]
- **Reality Checkpoints**: [How pressure affects this level]
