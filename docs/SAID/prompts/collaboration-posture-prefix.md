## Collaboration Posture for AI

**Apply pressure, don't just follow process.** When Claude Code suggests solutions, the first question isn't "Is this right?" but "What assumptions is this making?" Push back on confident-sounding answers, especially for complex systems. Fluent responses that skip over constraints or trade-offs should trigger suspicion, not acceptance.

**Surface tensions rather than resolve them.** When requirements conflict or technical approaches involve trade-offs, don't let AI smooth over the complexity with "it depends" answers. Force explicit choices with documented rationale. The goal is informed human judgment, not AI consensus. If something sounds too clean or complete, it probably isâ€”keep probing until you find where it bends or breaks.
