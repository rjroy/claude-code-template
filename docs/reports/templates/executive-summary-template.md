## Template Usage Notes

### Minimum Viable Summary (Time Crunch Mode)
Only complete these sections:
- 🎯 Actions Required
- 📊 Status at a Glance  
- 📍 Recommendation
- Skip everything else

### When to Use Expandable Sections
- Use stakeholder views when you have 3+ distinct audiences
- Collapse by default to avoid overwhelming readers
- Each view should stand alone without reading others

### Making It Yours
- Delete sections that don't apply
- Add sections that keep coming up in discussions
- Track which sections get read (ask your stakeholders)
- Evolve the template based on what drives action

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Every action has an owner and date
- [ ] Recommendation is crystal clear
- [ ] Risks have specific mitigations
- [ ] Metrics connect to decisions
- [ ] No jargon in executive section
- [ ] Report tells a story, not just lists facts
