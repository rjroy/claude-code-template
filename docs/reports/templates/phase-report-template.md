## Template Usage Guide

### Minimum Viable Report (Time Pressure)
Complete only:
- 🎯 What You Need to Know First
- 💡 Key Decision
- ✅ Primary Validation Result
- Next step recommendation

### Standard Report
Use all sections but keep concise - aim for 3-4 pages total

### Comprehensive Report (Major Phases)
Add detailed validation methodology, extensive metrics, append technical specifications

### Writing Tips
1. **Lead with action** - What needs to happen dominates what happened
2. **Plain English** - If your mom wouldn't understand it, rewrite it
3. **Evidence-based** - Every finding needs data or artifacts
4. **Story flow** - Reports should read like a narrative, not a form
5. **Scannable** - Use headers, bullets, and tables for quick scanning

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Decision maker could act based only on first section
- [ ] All findings have evidence
- [ ] Every risk has a mitigation
- [ ] Metrics connect to decisions
- [ ] Next steps have owners and dates
- [ ] Report tells a coherent story

### Evolving This Template
- Track which sections get skipped - remove them
- Note what questions come up repeatedly - add sections
- Time how long reports take to write - streamline
- Ask readers what they actually use - emphasize that
