# Git Workflow Additional Considerations

## ü§ù Thoughtful Code Review Practices

### Domain Complexity Considerations

Consider matching review requirements to code complexity:

**Simple Domains** (utilities, UI components):
- Any team member can review
- Focus on code style and basic functionality
- Quick turnaround expected

**Complex Domains** (auth, data processing):
- Consider involving domain experts
- Review architecture and security implications
- Allow time for thorough review

**Extreme Domains** (payments, healthcare, trading):
- Multiple expert reviews recommended
- Consider compliance requirements
- Document review decisions

**Optional: Using CODEOWNERS**
If your team finds it helpful, GitHub's CODEOWNERS file can suggest reviewers:

```yaml
# .github/CODEOWNERS (example)
# This is optional - adapt to your team's structure
*.js        @frontend-team
*.py        @backend-team
/docs/      @documentation-team

# Sensitive areas might need specific reviewers
/src/auth/  @security-team
/src/payment/ @payment-team @security-team
```

### Pull Request Templates

**Suggested PR Checklist Template**

Consider using a PR template to encourage thoughtful review. Here's an example that teams can adapt:

`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes and why they're needed.

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## Review Checklist

**Consider these review points:**
- [ ] Tests added/updated as needed
- [ ] Documentation updated if interfaces changed
- [ ] Major decisions documented (consider adding to context/)
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance impact assessed for large-scale changes

## Domain Complexity
Is this change in a complex domain that needs special review?
- [ ] No - standard review is fine
- [ ] Yes - please suggest appropriate reviewers

## Additional Notes
Any context that would help reviewers?

---
*Tip: Adapt this template to your team's needs. Remove items that don't apply.*
```

**Why Use Checklists?**
- Encourage thoughtful review without being prescriptive
- Remind developers of important considerations
- Can be adapted per project needs
- Not meant to be blindly checked - each item should prompt thinking

## üîÑ Quality Assurance Approaches

### Manual Review Checklists Over Automation

We recommend thoughtful manual review over rigid automated enforcement. Here's why:

1. **Flexibility**: Every project has unique needs
2. **Thoughtfulness**: Checklists prompt thinking, not blind compliance
3. **Adaptability**: Teams can adjust practices as they learn
4. **Trust**: Developers are trusted to make good decisions

### Suggested Review Checklist for PRs

**Before Merging, Consider:**

```markdown
## Pre-Merge Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows team style guidelines
- [ ] No obvious bugs or security issues
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

### Testing
- [ ] New functionality has tests
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Manual testing completed where needed

### Documentation
- [ ] Code is self-documenting or has comments where needed
- [ ] API changes are documented
- [ ] Complex decisions are explained
- [ ] README updated if needed

### Context Preservation (for significant changes)
- [ ] Major decisions added to context files
- [ ] Trade-offs documented
- [ ] Future maintainers will understand why
```

### Optional: Automated Checks

If your team wants some automation, focus on objective checks:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (example)
name: CI
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Check lint
      run: npm run lint
```

**Note**: Keep automation focused on objective quality (tests, lint) not process compliance.
