# AI-Human Collaboration Template

A meta-template for establishing effective AI-human collaboration patterns in software development, featuring pressure-tested methodologies for managing complex projects with Claude Code.

## Core Framework

**AI Spec-Driven Development (ASDD) v1.0** - Spiral development approach with progressive detail levels (Vision → Approach → Structure → Specifics → Implementation) that handles changing requirements, timeline pressure, and context preservation.

**Philosophy** - A comprehensive collaboration framework that has been forged through pressure and refined by reality. This philosophy addresses the collaboration paradox where AI can offer answers that look complete but may miss critical domain complexities. It establishes clear ownership boundaries: human judgment handles strategy and architecture, AI handles implementation and pattern recognition, with explicit accountability for every significant choice. The framework includes domain-aware collaboration patterns that scale AI involvement inversely with domain complexity, pressure-adaptive protocols that maintain quality under stress, and bounded replaceability principles that design components with stable interfaces enabling informed replacement decisions.

## Key Components

- **Spiral Navigation** - Flexible progression through development levels with backward navigation when discoveries invalidate assumptions
- **Domain Calibration** - AI involvement scales from full implementation in simple domains to boilerplate-only in extreme domains
- **Context Preservation** - Active management to prevent information degradation across phase transitions
- **Pressure Adaptation** - Protocols for maintaining quality under timeline stress without abandoning process
- **Bounded Replaceability** - Design components with realistic replacement cost assessment and clear behavioral contracts

## Getting Started

**Before starting any project with this template, create these two files:**

- **OVERVIEW.md**: A short description for the project. The elevator pitch.
- **HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md**: A description of all the key core principles and requirements that are necessary to consider the project successful. This is not a detailed design, but should be defined enough for reasonable repeatability.

## Available Commands

Complete ASDD v1.0 command set:
- `/phase-0-prototype` - Risk validation through proof-of-concept
- `/level-0-vision` - Problem clarity and core purpose  
- `/level-1-approach` - Technical approach validation
- `/level-2-structure` - System boundaries and components
- `/level-3-specifics` - Detailed implementation specifications
- `/level-4-implementation` - Production-ready code delivery

## What Makes This Different

This template has been pressure-tested against systematic failure analysis and incorporates real-world learnings from project breakdowns. Version 1.0 addresses timeline pressure, context degradation, domain complexity mismatches, and collaboration boundary drift - the common failure modes that break clean development processes.

**Philosophy**: Trust through verification, not verification through trust. This template provides the structure for AI-human collaboration that bends under pressure rather than breaking.
