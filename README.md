A meta-template for establishing AI-human collaboration patterns in software development. SAID addresses the collaboration paradox: AI excels at quick solutions for well-understood domains, but complex problems require progressive understanding to avoid incomplete solutions that miss critical constraints.

## Core Framework

<img src="docs/SAID/logos/said-64.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px">

**Spiral AI Development (SAID)** - A methodology for AI-human collaboration that navigates uncertainty through progressive certainty. Rather than linear phases, SAID uses thresholds of understanding to make decisions only when you have sufficient information.

**The Collaboration Paradox** - AI provides fluent, complete-looking solutions that often miss critical constraints. This creates false confidence - solutions that "look right" but fail when tested against reality. SAID addresses this through iterative deepening: identifying and resolving nuances before implementation, not after.

## Key Components

- **Context as Navigation Aid** - Context files are maps through the spiral, not just documentation. SAID addresses four context problems: poisoning (errors repeated), distraction (overwhelm), confusion (too many options), and clash (contradictions).

- **Progressive Detail Levels** - Make decisions only at appropriate thresholds:
  - **Level 0**: Problem + Risk Clarity
  - **Level 1**: Approach Viability
  - **Level 2**: Structure Definition
  - **Level 3**: Implementation Specifics
  - **Level 4**: Working Implementation

- **Ownership Architecture** - Clear boundaries between human judgment (strategy, trade-offs), AI assistance (research, implementation), and shared territory (review, testing).

- **High-Performing Intern Pattern** - Commands behave like skilled interns: adaptive checkpoints over rigid templates, bounded initiative, context-aware depth, and efficient question bundling.

- **Bounded Replaceability** - Design components so any piece can be understood and replaced without archaeological investigation. The Investigation-Decision-Integration pattern provides the natural workflow rhythm.

## Getting Started

This is a GitHub template repository.  Getting started is as simple as creating a repository using this as a template.

Actually, the first step is to have an idea. Be bold. Be vague. Be inspired. Whatever it is, write it down.

- **OVERVIEW.md**: A short description for the project. The elevator pitch.
- **HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md**: A description of all the key core principles and requirements that are necessary to consider the project successful. This is not a detailed design, but does set up the next steps. Don't worry, you can refine it through the process.

Please follow the [Getting Started](/docs/SAID/getting-started/README.md) complete guide.
