A meta-template for establishing AI-human collaboration patterns in software development, designed for managing complex projects with Claude Code.

## Core Framework

<img src="docs/SAID/logos/said-64.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px">

**Spiral AI Development (SAID)** - Spiral development approach with progressive detail levels (Prototype → Vision → Approach → Structure → Specifics → Implementation) that handles changing requirements, timeline pressure, and context preservation, now with integrated git workflow support.

**Philosophy** - AI excels at generating quick small solutions for well understood domains. The current AI collaboration loop therefore relies on the user breaking the problem down and clearly defining it before starting. If you don't then you get a quick small solution for a complex problem, which doesn't work as you expect. Spiral AI Development addresses this by adapting proven development principles to AI collaboration. The framework provides both a spiral methodology and command tools to navigate it consistently.

## Key Components

- **Context Building** - The greatest power and enemy of AI is its context. Working on a complex problem can be difficult if it loses context. You need to build it up, and preserve it.
- **Domain Breakdown** - One of the problems is knowing where to draw the lines between components and features. It is also one of the most important action you can do when working with AI.
- **Spiral Methodology** - The traditional spiral development model can be adapted to most modern agile development processes. As you progress through the methodology it is important to add new context for future levels of the spiral. But more important adjust past assumptions that are now wrong and recalibrate.
- **Human in the Loop** - This methodology isn't a push button solution. It is designed to take advantage of the greatest domain expert the AI has access to, the user. This is your project, it needs to ask you questions.
- **Command Driven** - This is all great in theory, but in practice you need more than just words to maintain consistency. Spiral AI Development isn't just a philosophy, it is a toolkit template. It provides a baseline set of commands to support all the core concepts (and some optional ones) to allow for consistency in the development for multiple projects.

## What Makes This Different

This template is designed to address timeline pressure, context degradation, domain complexity mismatches, and collaboration boundary drift - common failure modes that can break clean development processes.

Recommended git workflow that teams can adapt to support SAID collaboration patterns. See [Git Workflow Integration](docs/SAID/git-workflow-integration.md) for flexible guidance that you can modify or ignore based on your team's needs.

**Philosophy**: Trust through verification, not verification through trust. This template provides structure designed for AI-human collaboration that aims to bend under pressure rather than breaking.

## Getting Started

This is a GitHub template repository.  Getting started is as simple as creating a repository using this as a template.

Actually, the first step is to have an idea. Be bold. Be vague. Be inspired. Whatever it is, write it down.

- **OVERVIEW.md**: A short description for the project. The elevator pitch.
- **HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md**: A description of all the key core principles and requirements that are necessary to consider the project successful. This is not a detailed design, but does set up the next steps. Don't worry, you can refine it through the process.

Please follow the Getting Started [README.md](docs/SAID/getting-started/README.md) for a complete guide.
