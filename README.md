# claude-code-template

This is intended as a template for future projects.

The template itself will need support to flesh out into a state that can easily be copied.

Each project will need two user provided files always:
- **OVERVIEW.md**: A short description for the project. The elevator pitch.
- **HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md**: A description of all the key core principles and requirements that are necessary to consider the project successful.  This is not a detailed design, but should be defined enough for reasonable repeatability.
