# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **meta-template repository** for establishing AI-human collaboration patterns in software development. It contains no implementation code but provides philosophical and procedural frameworks for future projects.

## Core Philosophy

The development philosophy is documented in [ASDD/Philosophy.md](ASDD/Philosophy.md). Key principles include:

### Collaboration Framework
1. **Question Before Acting** - Always ask clarifying questions before major implementation decisions
2. **Present Options** - Provide pros/cons rather than choosing for the user
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share the "why" behind technical recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Honor collaboration checkpoints at key decision points

### Regenerative Architecture Principle
Design components that can be easily regenerated by any competent developer (human or AI) with access to clear requirements. This means:
- Clear, minimal interfaces that hide implementation complexity
- Self-contained functionality with explicit dependencies
- Well-defined boundaries that resist scope creep
- Comprehensive tests that serve as behavioral specification

## AI Spec-Driven Development (ASDD) Workflow

This template establishes a 6-phase workflow for breaking down large specifications:

1. **High Level Review**: Design → Core Features + Architecture
2. **Feature Review**: Features → Detailed Designs  
3. **Detailed Review**: Designs → Component Designs
4. **Component Review**: Components → Issue Designs
5. **Issue Review**: Issues → Task Lists
6. **Implementation**: Tasks → Code

Each phase includes failure mode detection and response patterns documented in the philosophy file.

## Using This Template

### For New Projects

When starting a new project with this template:

1. **Create Required Files**:
   - `OVERVIEW.md` - Elevator pitch for the project
   - `HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md` - Core principles and requirements

2. **Customize ASDD Commands**:
   - Use `.claude/commands/review-feature.md` as a template
   - Create phase-specific commands using `ASDD/claude-command-template/phase-template.md`

3. **Establish Project-Specific Standards**:
   - Define technology stack and tooling
   - Set up testing and build infrastructure
   - Create project-specific coding standards

### Command Structure

Custom Claude commands follow this pattern:
```markdown
## Usage
/command-name <parameters>

## Command Guidelines
[Role definition and success criteria]

## Command
[Specific instructions for Claude]
```

## Collaboration Patterns

### When Working on ASDD Phases

For each phase, apply the standard pressure-testing protocol:

1. **Assumption Validation** - What must be true for this to work?
2. **Integration Reality Check** - How does this connect to existing work?
3. **Implementation Feasibility Gate** - Can this actually be built as described?
4. **Scope Boundary Testing** - What's excluded and why?
5. **Failure Mode Prediction** - Where might this break down?

### When Philosophy Conflicts with Reality

The philosophy is designed to evolve. When encountering conflicts:
1. Document what broke and why
2. Assess if the breakage was environmental or structural
3. Propose updated principles that would have prevented the failure
4. Test new principles against historical project pressure

## Key Files

- `ASDD/Philosophy.md` - Complete development philosophy and collaboration framework
- `ASDD/claude-command-template/phase-template.md` - Template for creating ASDD phase commands
- `.claude/commands/review-feature.md` - Example ASDD Phase 2 command implementation
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration

## Important Notes

- This template contains no implementation code, build scripts, or dependencies
- The focus is on establishing collaborative patterns before coding begins
- All principles are designed to handle project pressure and real-world constraints
- The philosophy explicitly includes failure modes and escape valves

When using this template for a new project, replace this generic CLAUDE.md with project-specific guidance including actual build commands, testing strategies, and architectural patterns once they're established.
