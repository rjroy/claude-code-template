## Purpose
Analyze problem space to identify core issues, user needs, and validate problem importance through stakeholder perspectives.

## Goal
- Problem validation

## Research Area
- Research industry research on similar problems
- Research existing solutions and their limitations
- Find market studies and user research reports
- Gather evidence about problem space and user pain points

### Core Problem Questions
- "What specific problem does this solve for whom?"
- "How do users currently handle this problem?"
- "What makes the current solution inadequate?"
- "What would success look like from the user's perspective?"


## Analysis Guidelines
- Define scope boundaries and business context
- Prioritize problem understanding, not solutions
- Emphasize problem constraints and requirements, not implementation solutions
- Emphasize user perspective and validation

### Current State Analysis
- How users currently handle this
- Pain points and limitations
- Workarounds being used
- Cost of current approach

### User Impact Assessment
- Primary user groups affected
- User constraints and contexts
- User success criteria
- Evidence of user need

### Problem Validation Criteria
- Evidence this is a real problem
- User validation data/feedback
- Market indicators (if applicable)
- Consequences of not solving

### Validation Questions
- "Is this solving a real problem or a perceived problem?"
- "Do the identified users actually want this solved?"
- "What evidence do we have that this is worth solving?"
- "What happens if this problem remains unsolved?"
- "What technical constraints make this problem complex?"
- "What architectural requirements emerge from this problem?"
- "What system integration challenges does this problem present?"
- "What performance, security, or scale considerations are inherent to this problem?"

### Scope Definition
- What's included in problem scope
- What's explicitly excluded
- Potential scope creep areas
- Related problems not being addressed

### Business Context Integration
- Business impact assessment
- Strategic alignment score
- Resource investment justification
- Timing considerations

### Validation Sources
- User research reports
- Market studies
- Competitive analysis
- Industry pain point documentation
- User feedback and testimonials
