## Purpose
Identify, analyze, and categorize risks with mitigation strategies using role-based expertise and industry research.

## Goal
- Identify risk patterns

## Research Area
- Research industry risk patterns and failure cases
- Research project failure case studies and post-mortems
- Find industry risk reports and security advisories
- Look up common pitfalls and anti-patterns

### Risk Discovery Methods
- **Assumption extraction**: Identify implicit and explicit assumptions
- **Stress testing scenarios**: Test assumptions under extreme conditions
- **Role-specific risk patterns**: Apply expertise-based risk identification
- **Cross-role synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple perspectives
- **Emergent risk detection**: Identify risks from role interactions

### Analysis Guidelines
- Analyze likelihood and impact for each risk
- Apply risk prioritization matrix
- Develop role-informed mitigation strategies
- Use role-based expertise combined with industry evidence
- Provide specific, actionable mitigation strategies
- Prioritize prevention and preparedness
- Include role-specific early warning indicators

### Risk Classification
- **Category**: Technical/Implementation/Integration/Business/Operational
- **Likelihood**: Low/Medium/High with justification
- **Impact**: Low/Medium/High with consequences
- **Root Cause**: Why this risk exists

### Risk Prioritization
- Risk matrix plotting (likelihood Ã— impact)
- Critical path impact assessment
- Cascade risk identification
- Timeline sensitivity analysis

### Mitigation Strategy Framework
- **Prevention**: How to reduce likelihood
- **Impact Reduction**: How to minimize consequences
- **Contingency**: What to do if it happens
- **Risk Transfer**: Options for shifting risk

### Validation Methods
- **Assumption validation**: Methods to test critical assumptions
- **Early warning indicators**: Signals to watch for
- **Risk trigger identification**: Specific activation conditions
- **Monitoring mechanisms**: Ongoing assessment methods

### Risk Interconnection Analysis
- How risks might amplify each other
- Sequential failure patterns
- Common mode failures
- System-wide vulnerabilities

### Monitoring and Response
- **Review Frequency**: When to reassess risks
- **Key Indicators**: Metrics to track
- **Escalation Triggers**: When to take action
- **Responsibility Matrix**: Who monitors what

### Contingency Planning
- **Resources needed**: For risk response
- **Decision trees**: When to activate responses
- **Communication plans**: Who to notify when
- **Recovery procedures**: How to restore operations
