## Specialized Knowledge

### PWA Architecture Principles
- **Offline-First**: Design for offline functionality as the default, online as enhancement
- **App Shell**: Separate application shell from dynamic content for optimal caching
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, enhance with advanced features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with fluid layouts and touch interactions
- **Performance Budget**: Prioritize fast loading and smooth interactions over feature richness
- **Network Resilience**: Handle connectivity issues gracefully with fallbacks and retry mechanisms

### Decision Criteria
When making PWA architectural decisions, consider:
1. **Network Reliability**: Assume poor/intermittent connectivity as normal state
2. **Storage Constraints**: Browser storage quotas and data persistence guarantees
3. **Performance Impact**: Loading speed vs feature richness trade-offs
4. **Device Capabilities**: Touch interfaces, screen sizes, hardware limitations
5. **Browser Support**: Feature availability across target browser ecosystem
6. **Maintenance Complexity**: Service worker lifecycle and cache management overhead

### Core PWA Components

#### Service Worker Architecture
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Prefer cached content, fallback to network
- **Network-First Strategy**: For frequently changing data with cache fallback
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Serve cached content, update in background
- **Cache-Only/Network-Only**: For specific use cases (assets vs real-time data)
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Handle API failures gracefully with automated recovery

#### Storage Strategy
- **IndexedDB**: Complex data with transactions and indexing
- **Cache API**: HTTP requests/responses caching
- **LocalStorage**: Simple key-value data (synchronous, limited)
- **SessionStorage**: Temporary data within browser session
- **WebSQL**: Deprecated, avoid in new projects

#### App Shell Components
- **Static Shell**: Navigation, headers, core UI components
- **Dynamic Content**: User data, API responses, real-time updates
- **Offline Fallbacks**: Meaningful error states and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States**: Progressive content loading with skeleton screens

### Best Practices

#### Service Worker Implementation
```javascript
// Cache-first with network fallback
// Aggressive caching for static assets
// Conservative caching for dynamic content
// Implement proper cache versioning
// Handle service worker updates gracefully
```

#### Performance Optimization
- Implement critical resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
- Use resource prioritization for above-the-fold content
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle splitting for optimal loading patterns
- Image optimization with responsive images and lazy loading

#### Offline UX Patterns
- Clear offline indicators and messaging
- Offline-capable forms with queue-and-sync patterns
- Background sync for deferred operations
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities
- Meaningful offline content and functionality

### Tools & Ecosystem

#### Build Tools & Frameworks
- **Workbox**: Google's PWA toolkit for service workers
- **PWA Builder**: Microsoft's PWA development tools
- **React**: Create React App PWA template, Next.js PWA plugin
- **Vue**: Vue CLI PWA plugin, Nuxt.js PWA module
- **Angular**: Angular PWA schematic and service worker
- **Svelte**: SvelteKit service worker integration

#### Testing & Debugging
- **Lighthouse**: PWA auditing and performance analysis
- **Chrome DevTools**: Service worker debugging and cache inspection
- **PWA Testing**: Offline testing, push notification testing
- **WebPageTest**: Performance testing with different network conditions
- **Device Testing**: Real device testing across iOS/Android browsers

#### Deployment & Monitoring
- **HTTPS**: Required for service workers and PWA features
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for optimal performance
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push API with proper fallbacks
- **App Store Distribution**: PWA installation via app stores
- **Analytics**: Track offline usage, service worker performance

### PWA-Specific Architecture Patterns

#### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
```
1. Memory Cache (Runtime caching)
2. Service Worker Cache (Cache API)
3. IndexedDB (Structured data storage)
4. Network (Fallback with retry logic)
```

#### Data Synchronization Patterns
- **Event-Driven Sync**: Background sync on connectivity restoration
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins vs operational transformation
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with server reconciliation
- **Queue Management**: Offline operation queuing and batch processing

#### Progressive Enhancement Layers
1. **Core Functionality**: Works without JavaScript
2. **Enhanced UX**: JavaScript-powered interactions
3. **Offline Capability**: Service worker and caching
4. **Platform Integration**: Web APIs and native features

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Assuming reliable network connectivity in architecture decisions
- Over-caching dynamic content leading to stale data issues
- Ignoring service worker lifecycle and update patterns
- Not handling storage quota exceeded errors gracefully
- Complex service worker logic that's hard to debug and maintain
- Blocking main thread with heavy IndexedDB operations
- Not testing offline scenarios thoroughly
- Ignoring iOS Safari PWA limitations and quirks

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### iOS Safari Limitations
- Limited service worker cache size (50MB quota)
- No background sync or push notifications
- Install banner restrictions and App Store competition
- Different storage persistence guarantees
- Touch interaction and viewport behavior differences

#### Android Chrome Advantages
- Full PWA feature support including background sync
- Web App Manifest support for app-like installation
- Push notification support with rich interactions
- Better storage persistence and quota management
- Hardware access APIs (camera, geolocation, etc.)

### Performance Guidelines
- Target < 3 seconds for initial load on 3G networks
- Implement proper resource prioritization and critical path optimization
- Use service worker for aggressive static asset caching
- Implement efficient data fetching patterns with pagination
- Optimize for memory usage in long-running applications
- Monitor and optimize for battery usage impact

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS requirement for service workers and PWA APIs
- Content Security Policy configuration for service workers
- Secure storage of sensitive data with encryption
- Input validation for offline form submissions
- Protection against service worker-based attacks
- Regular security audits for cached content and API endpoints

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Track service worker registration and update success rates
- Monitor cache hit rates and storage usage patterns
- Measure offline usage patterns and feature adoption
- Track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- Monitor push notification engagement and conversion rates
- Analyze installation and retention patterns across platforms
