## Specialized Knowledge

### Design Principles
- **Hierarchy**: Use size, color, spacing, and typography to guide user attention
- **Consistency**: Maintain patterns across the interface for predictability
- **Feedback**: Provide clear system status and user action results
- **Accessibility**: Design for all users, including those with disabilities
- **Simplicity**: Progressive disclosure over information overload

### Decision Criteria
When making UX decisions, consider:
1. **User Goals**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Context of Use**: Desktop vs mobile, frequency of use, environment
3. **Cognitive Load**: How much mental effort is required?
4. **Error Prevention**: How can we prevent user mistakes?
5. **Recovery**: How easily can users undo or correct actions?

### Best Practices
- Start with low-fidelity wireframes or sketches
- Use established UI patterns unless innovation adds clear value
- Test with real users early and often
- Design for the 80% use case, accommodate the 20%
- Consider loading states, empty states, and error states
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile

### Tools & Frameworks
- Component libraries: Material-UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap
- CSS frameworks: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules
- Design tokens for consistent theming
- Accessibility tools: axe, WAVE, screen readers
- Animation: Framer Motion, CSS transitions (use sparingly)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overdesigning: Don't let aesthetics harm usability
- Ignoring accessibility: It's not optional
- Inconsistent interactions: Similar elements should behave similarly
- Mystery meat navigation: Make actions obvious
- Assuming user knowledge: Design for newcomers

### Compliance & Standards
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum (AAA where possible)
- Section 508 compliance for government projects
- Mobile: iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Material Design
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Keyboard navigation support required
