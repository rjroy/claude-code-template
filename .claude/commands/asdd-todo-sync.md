## Command Guidelines

### ASDD TODO Sync Assistant

**Purpose**: Integrate TODO work results into appropriate ASDD context files and complete lifecycle
**Focus**: Preserve valuable insights while maintaining context coherence and cleaning up temporary artifacts
**Output**: Updated ASDD contexts with TODO insights integrated and TODO artifacts archived or cleaned

### Collaboration Framework

1. **Question Before Acting** - Clarify which ASDD levels are affected and integration approach
2. **Present Options** - Offer different integration strategies and impact scopes
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share rationale for context updates and cleanup decisions
4. **Pause for Input** - Confirm integration scope when impact assessment is unclear

### Task Guidelines

**TODO Sync Process**

**1. TODO Work Discovery and Assessment**
- Scan all TODO context files matching the identifier pattern
- Extract completed work, decisions, and lessons learned
- Assess impact scope on ASDD levels and project context
- Identify backward feedback that affects previous phases
- Determine integration requirements and cleanup needs

**2. Impact Analysis and Integration Planning**
- Map TODO findings to affected ASDD levels
- Identify context updates needed for project coherence
- Plan integration strategy with user if scope is unclear
- Assess potential conflicts with existing context
- Prepare integration artifacts and update sequences

**3. Context Integration and Lifecycle Completion**
- Update affected ASDD level contexts with TODO insights
- Integrate lessons learned into project context manifest
- Resolve conflicts using established resolution strategies
- Apply comprehensive artifact preservation using enhanced valuable criteria
- Clean up temporary TODO scaffolding while preserving all implementation assets

### TODO Identifier Patterns

**Directory-Based Identification**:
- `context/todo/{todo-name}` - Single TODO and all its decompositions
- `context/todo/{todo-name}/*` - All files in TODO directory tree
- Pattern matching supports partial identifiers for batch operations

**Discovery Process**:
```yaml
discovery_process:
  - step: "Scan TODO directories"
    action: "Find all TODO contexts matching identifier"
    
  - step: "Assess completion status"
    action: "Determine which TODOs have execution artifacts"
    
  - step: "Extract integration artifacts"
    action: "Gather decisions, constraints, and lessons learned"
    
  - step: "Map to ASDD levels"
    action: "Identify which contexts need updates"
```

### Integration Impact Assessment

**ASDD Level Impact Mapping**:
- **Level 0 (Vision)**: Fundamental assumptions or requirements discovered
- **Level 1 (Approach)**: Technical approach limitations or new capabilities
- **Level 2 (Structure)**: Component boundaries or interface discoveries
- **Level 3 (Specifics)**: Implementation constraints or design patterns
- **Level 4 (Implementation)**: Lessons learned and operational insights
- **Project Context**: Cross-cutting decisions and constraint discoveries

**Backward Feedback Handling**:
```yaml
backward_feedback_types:
  - type: "Constraint Discovery"
    description: "New technical or business constraints found"
    target_levels: ["level-1-approach", "level-2-structure"]
    integration_method: "Add to technical_constraints section"
    
  - type: "Assumption Invalidation"
    description: "Work revealed assumptions were incorrect"
    target_levels: ["level-0-vision", "level-1-approach"]
    integration_method: "Update key_decisions with new rationale"
    
  - type: "Interface Issues"
    description: "Component boundaries need adjustment"
    target_levels: ["level-2-structure", "level-3-specifics"]
    integration_method: "Update component definitions and interfaces"
    
  - type: "Implementation Lessons"
    description: "Patterns and practices for future work"
    target_levels: ["project-context"]
    integration_method: "Add to lessons_learned section"
```

### Integration Templates

**Context Update Template**:
```yaml
context_update:
  source_todo: "Reference to originating TODO"
  update_type: "ADDITION | MODIFICATION | CORRECTION"
  affected_sections: ["Which parts of context are updated"]
  
  integration_artifacts:
    decisions:
      - decision: "New decision from TODO work"
        rationale: "Why this decision was made"
        alternatives: "Options considered during TODO work"
        confidence: 0.8
        source_todo: "Which TODO generated this"
        
    constraints:
      - constraint: "New constraint discovered"
        source: "TODO work that revealed this"
        impact: "How this affects design"
        mitigation: "How to handle this constraint"
        
    lessons_learned:
      - lesson: "What was learned"
        context: "Specific TODO work context"
        applicability: "Where this applies in future"
        confidence: "How certain we are about this"
```

**Valuable Artifact Classification**:
```yaml
artifact_classification:
  always_archive_critical_assets:
    deliverables:
      - "All deliverables/ directories from every subtask"
      - "Complete specifications and algorithm definitions"
      - "API specifications and interface contracts"
      - "Performance models and optimization strategies"
      - "User experience designs and control specifications"
    
    structured_data:

      - "YAML specifications (taxonomies, algorithms, configs)"
      - "XML datasets and cached API responses"
      - "Test scenarios and validation datasets"
      - "Real data caches (expensive to recreate)"
    
    executable_artifacts:
      - "Scripts and automation tools (.py, .js, .sh)"
      - "API integration code and utilities"
      - "Data collection and analysis tools"

      - "Integration validation reports"
      - "Technical constraint discoveries"
  
  conditionally_archive_context_dependent:
    - "execution-log.yml files (only if containing unique technical insights)"
    - "Source TODO contexts (only if containing refined requirements not captured elsewhere)"
    - "Working files that led to breakthrough discoveries or constraint identification"
    - "Draft specifications that contain unique approaches not in final versions"
  
  safe_to_delete_temporary_scaffolding:
    - "TODO context scaffolding (todo-context.yml files after integration)"
    - "Decomposition plans after subtask completion"
    - "Empty directories and structural scaffolding"
    - "Duplicate files where final versions supersede drafts"
    - "Process logs without technical content"

archive_value_assessment:
  priority_principles:
    - "Data artifacts > Process artifacts (cached data more valuable than execution logs)"
    - "Executable specs > Narrative descriptions (algorithms more valuable than summaries)"
    - "Validation datasets > Synthetic examples (real test data prevents regression)"
    - "Complete deliverables > Partial drafts (finished work more valuable than iterations)"
    - "Structured data > Unstructured text (JSON/YAML more valuable than markdown summaries)"
  
  cost_avoidance_factors:
    - "External API caches (expensive due to rate limiting)"
    - "Research analysis results (time-intensive to recreate)"
    - "Validated algorithms (prevent re-implementation)"

      - "Include decisions and lessons from each subtask"
      - "Link archived artifacts to updated ASDD contexts"
```

### Collaboration Decision Points

**When to Ask for User Input**:
- **Unclear Impact Scope**: TODO affects multiple levels but integration target unclear
- **Conflicting Information**: TODO findings conflict with existing decisions
- **Significant Backward Feedback**: Changes affect fundamental assumptions
- **Resource Constraints**: Integration would require significant context restructuring
- **Quality Concerns**: TODO deliverables don't meet integration quality standards

**Example Collaboration Prompts**:
- "This TODO revealed constraints that affect Level 1 approach decisions. Should I update the approach or note this as a future consideration?"
- "The TODO work conflicts with existing component boundaries. Should I propose boundary changes or document this as a known limitation?"
- "This TODO generated significant lessons learned. Should these be integrated into project context or archived for reference?"

### Quality Assurance

**Before Integration**:
- [ ] All TODO artifacts discovered and assessed
- [ ] Impact scope clearly defined and validated
