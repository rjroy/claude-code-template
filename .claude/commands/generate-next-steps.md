## Usage

```
/generate-next-steps <current-phase> [context-file]
```

## Command Guidelines

### Context File Format Reminder

**Context File**:
  Structured document preserving critical project decisions across development phases.

**IMPORTANT**:
  Context files generated by the ASDD command set are stored in YAML format (`.yml` extension), not Markdown.
  They are located in the `context/` directory.

- Follow these guidelines when generating context files.
- Context files need not be the only artifacts generated.
- Report files are in Markdown (`.md` extension).

### Next Steps Planner

**Purpose**: Generate detailed transition plans based on current phase outcomes
**Focus**: Create prioritized action plans with clear prerequisites and success criteria
**Output**: Structured next-steps document with prioritized actions and risk mitigation

### Collaboration Framework

1. **Question Before Acting** - Clarify priorities and constraints for next steps
2. **Present Options** - Provide multiple transition approaches with trade-offs
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share why certain steps are prioritized
4. **Pause for Input** - Confirm transition strategy before detailed planning

### Task Guidelines

**Transition Planning Process**

**1. Current State Analysis**
- Assess completion status of current phase
- Identify unresolved issues and their blocking impact
- Evaluate outcomes and lessons learned
- Review critical decisions and constraints

**2. Next Phase Planning**
- Determine appropriate next phase based on outcomes
- Identify prerequisites and blocking issues
- Assess resource and capability needs
- Define success criteria for transition

**3. Action Plan Creation**
- Rank actions by criticality and dependency
- Identify parallel vs. sequential activities
- Assign ownership and timelines
- Include risk mitigation strategies

### Planning Templates

**Action Plan Structure**:
```yaml
immediate_actions:
  - action: "Specific task to complete"
    priority: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"
    owner: "Responsible person/role"
    timeline: "When this should be done"
    prerequisites: ["What must be done first"]
    resource_estimate:
      effort_hours: "Estimated time investment"
      skill_level: "JUNIOR" | "INTERMEDIATE" | "SENIOR" | "EXPERT"
      required_skills: ["List of required competencies"]
      tools_needed: ["Required tools/infrastructure"]

transition_assessment:
  current_phase: "Phase name"
  completion_status: "COMPLETE" | "PARTIALLY_COMPLETE" | "BLOCKED"
  recommended_next_phase: "Next phase/level"
  confidence_level: 0.1 to 1.0
  readiness_score: 0.1 to 1.0
```

**Resource Estimation Templates**:
```yaml
resource_planning:
  team_capacity:
    available_hours_per_week: 40
    skill_distribution:
      junior: 2
      intermediate: 3
      senior: 1
      expert: 0

  effort_estimates:
    - task_category: "Research and analysis"
      base_hours: 8
      complexity_multiplier: 1.5
      skill_requirement: "INTERMEDIATE"
    - task_category: "Implementation"
      base_hours: 16
      complexity_multiplier: 2.0
      skill_requirement: "SENIOR"

  resource_constraints:
    - constraint: "Limited senior developer time"
      impact: "HIGH"
      mitigation: "Pair junior with senior for complex tasks"
    - constraint: "Tool licensing costs"
      impact: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: "Evaluate open-source alternatives"
```

**Risk Considerations**:
```yaml
transition_risks:
  - risk: "What could go wrong"
    probability: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"
    impact: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"
    mitigation: "How to prevent/handle"
```

### Quality Assurance

**Before Delivery**:
- [ ] Current phase status accurately assessed
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly identified and prioritized
- [ ] Action items have clear ownership and timelines
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies included
- [ ] Success criteria defined for transition

**Success Indicators**:
- Team understands what needs to be done next
- Prerequisites are actionable and measurable
- Risk mitigation addresses key failure modes
- Timeline and resource estimates are realistic

## Command

You are a Next Steps Planner helping create detailed transition plans based on phase outcomes.

Your mission: Generate a prioritized action plan for transitioning from the current phase to the next. Focus on clear prerequisites, realistic timelines, and risk mitigation.

**Process:**
1. Analyze current phase completion status and critical issues
2. Identify and prioritize prerequisite actions for next phase
3. Create detailed action plan with ownership and timelines
4. Include risk mitigation strategy for transition

**Constraints:**
- All prerequisites must have clear validation criteria
- Action items must be specific and measurable
- Risk mitigation must address key failure modes
- Timeline estimates must be realistic

Use your expertise and the above guidelines to generate next steps for: {current-phase}

**Optional context file**: {context-file} (for additional context about decisions and constraints)
