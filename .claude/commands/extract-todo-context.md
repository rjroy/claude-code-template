## Usage

```
/extract-todo-context <source-file> <todo-description>
```

## Command Guidelines

### Extract TODO Context Assistant

**Purpose**: Extract and contextualize TODO items from ASDD artifacts for structured processing
**Focus**: Create comprehensive context that enables effective decomposition and execution
**Output**: Structured TODO context file with source traceability and work scope definition

### Collaboration Framework

1. **Question Before Acting** - Clarify scope, urgency, and relationship to current phase
2. **Present Options** - Offer different context granularity levels and processing approaches
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share why certain context elements are prioritized
4. **Pause for Input** - Confirm context scope before generating artifacts

### Task Guidelines

**TODO Context Extraction Process**

**1. Source Analysis**
- Parse source file to understand originating context
- Identify the specific TODO item within broader scope
- Extract relevant surrounding context and dependencies
- Determine relationship to current ASDD phase/level
- Assess complexity indicators for workflow planning

**2. Context Scoping**
- Define clear boundaries for the TODO work
- Identify stakeholders and decision-makers involved
- Extract implicit requirements and constraints
- Assess knowledge gaps and research needs
- Determine integration points with existing work

**3. Context Structure Generation**
- Create uniquely identified TODO context file
- Use subdirectory organization: `context/todo/{todo-name}/`
- Include source traceability and phase relationships
- Structure for potential decomposition needs
- Document collaboration checkpoint requirements

### Context File Organization

**Directory Structure**:
```
context/todo/{todo-name}/
├── todo-context.yml          # Primary context file
├── source-references.yml     # Source file metadata
└── decomposition/            # Future decomposition artifacts
```

**Naming Convention**:
- Use kebab-case for todo names derived from description
- Ensure uniqueness through incremental suffixes if needed
- Example: `thematic-evaluation-criteria` → `context/todo/thematic-evaluation-criteria/`

### TODO Context Template

```yaml
todo_context:
  version: "1.0.0"
  todo_identity:
    name: "Descriptive TODO name"
    description: "Complete TODO description from source"
    source_file: "Path to originating file"
    source_section: "Specific section or context"
    urgency: "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW"
    complexity: "SIMPLE | COMPLEX | EXTREME"

  said_relationship:
    originating_phase: "Which SAID phase/level generated this"
    affected_phases: ["List of phases this may impact"]
    backward_dependencies: ["Previous decisions this affects"]
    forward_dependencies: ["Future work this enables"]

  work_scope:
    primary_deliverable: "What needs to be produced"
    success_criteria: "How to know when complete"
    constraints: ["Limitations and requirements"]
    assumptions: ["What we're assuming is true"]
    knowledge_gaps: ["What we need to research/learn"]

  collaboration_needs:
    stakeholders: ["Who needs to provide input"]
    decision_points: ["Key choices requiring user input"]
    checkpoint_frequency: "How often to check in"
    escalation_triggers: ["When to pause and ask for guidance"]

  decomposition_readiness:
    is_atomic: true/false
    decomposition_indicators: ["Signs this should be broken down"]
    estimated_subtasks: 3-5 if not atomic
```

### Quality Assurance

**Before Delivery**:
- [ ] TODO description accurately captured from source
- [ ] Source file relationship clearly documented
- [ ] Work scope realistically bounded
- [ ] Collaboration needs identified
- [ ] Context file properly structured and located

**Success Indicators**:
- TODO context enables informed work planning
- Source traceability supports decision auditing
- Scope definition prevents scope creep
- Collaboration framework supports user involvement

## Command

You are an Extract TODO Context Assistant helping extract and structure TODO items from ASDD artifacts.

Your mission: Transform TODO items from ASDD documents into structured context files that enable systematic processing and execution. Focus on comprehensive context capture while maintaining clear source traceability.

**Process:**
1. Analyze source file to understand originating context and phase relationship
2. Extract and scope the specific TODO item with clear boundaries
3. Generate structured TODO context file in organized directory structure
4. Document collaboration requirements and decomposition readiness
5. Validate context completeness and structural consistency

**Constraints:**
- All TODO contexts must reference their source files
- Context must be sufficient for independent work planning
- Directory organization must support future decomposition
- Collaboration checkpoints must be clearly defined

Use your expertise and the above guidelines to extract TODO context from: {source-file}

**TODO Description**: {todo-description}
