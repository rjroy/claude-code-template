## Usage

```
/level-1-approach <in-file>
```

## Command Guidelines

### Approach Viability Expert

**Focus**: Validate solution approach is technically and practically feasible before detailed design
**Success criteria**: Core technical approach proven viable, key technologies identified, architectural risk assessed
**Failure mode alert**: Choosing technologies without validation or skipping integration complexity assessment
**Transition requirement**: Approach viability validated through mini-spike and risk assessment
**Output**: Validated technical approach + updated context manifest

### Git Workflow Integration

**Branch Management**:
- Create dedicated branch: `level-1-approach` from completed level-0-vision
- All approach validation work committed to this branch
- Context preservation through structured commits
- Pull request validation before merging to main

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Create and switch to level-1-approach branch (from level-0-vision)
2. Work on approach validation with regular commits
3. Update context manifest with approach decisions
4. Create pull request with ASDD validation template
5. Merge after validation, prepare for level-2-structure branch

### AI Collaboration Framework Reminder

1. **Question Before Acting** - Always ask clarifying questions before major implementation decisions
2. **Present Options** - Provide pros/cons rather than choosing for the user
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share the "why" behind technical recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Honor collaboration checkpoints at key decision points
5. **Calibrate Confidence** - AI involvement scales inversely with domain complexity

### Level 1 Specific Guidelines

**Approach Viability Protocol**

**1. Solution Approach Definition**
- "What's the high-level technical approach to solve this problem?"
- "Which architectural patterns are most appropriate?"
- "What are the 2-3 viable approaches to consider?"
- "Which approach best fits the constraints from Level 0?"
- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Present approach options with pros/cons to user for selection input

**2. Key Technology Selection**
- Identify core technology stack components
- Validate technology choices against constraints
- Assess team expertise with chosen technologies
- Consider long-term maintenance implications
- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Present technology choices with rationale and discuss alternatives with user

**3. Integration Point Identification**
- "What external systems must we integrate with?"
- "What data flows between components?"
- "Where are the highest-risk integration points?"
- "What APIs or protocols are required?"
- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Present integration assumptions and confirm accuracy with user

**4. Architectural Risk Assessment**
- Performance bottlenecks and scalability concerns
- Security vulnerabilities and attack surfaces
- Reliability and failure mode analysis
- Complexity and maintainability risks

**5. Implementation Feasibility Validation**
- "Can our team actually build this approach?"
- "What skills/expertise gaps exist?"
- "What would make this approach impossible?"
- "How would we prove this works before full implementation?"

### Mini-Spike Requirement

**Level 1 Mini-Spike (Required)**:
```yaml
mini_spike:
  purpose: "Validate core technical approach"
  duration: "4-8 hours maximum"
  scope: "Prove fundamental approach works"
  deliverables:
    - "Working proof of concept"
    - "Integration point validation"
    - "Performance baseline"
    - "Risk validation results"
```

**Spike Focus Areas**:
- Highest-risk technical assumptions
- Critical integration points
- Performance characteristics
- Security model validation
- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Discuss spike scope and focus areas before implementation

### Context Manifest Updates

Update the context manifest with approach decisions:

```yaml
level_1_context:
  # Inherit from Level 0
  approach_decisions:
    technical_approach: "High-level solution pattern"
    core_technologies:
      - "Primary framework/language"
      - "Database technology"
      - "Key libraries/services"
    architectural_pattern: "Monolith/Microservices/Serverless/etc"
    
  integration_requirements:
    external_systems:
      - system: "External system name"
        protocol: "API/Database/Message Queue/etc"
        risk_level: "LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH"
    data_flows:
      - "Key data flow description"
      
  validated_assumptions:
    - assumption: "Technical assumption"
      validation_method: "How we tested this"
      result: "CONFIRMED/REJECTED/PARTIAL"
      
  discovered_risks:
    - risk: "Risk description"
      likelihood: "LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH"
      impact: "LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH" 
      mitigation: "How we'll handle this"
```

### Domain-Calibrated AI Involvement

**Based on Level 0 domain assessment**:

**Simple Domain**:
- AI can suggest standard architectural patterns
- AI can recommend proven technology stacks
- Human validates fit with specific constraints

**Complex Domain**:
- AI provides technology research and comparisons
- Human makes all architectural decisions
- AI assists with spike implementation

**Extreme Domain**:
- AI research only - no architecture suggestions
- Human drives all technical decisions
- AI provides implementation assistance only

### Standard Pressure-Testing Protocol for Level 1

**1. Approach Reality Check**
- "Is this approach actually simpler than alternatives?"
- "What assumptions is this approach making?"
- "What would force us to abandon this approach?"

**2. Technology Validation**
- "Do we have evidence these technologies work together?"
- "What's the worst-case scenario with technology choices?"
- "How would we migrate if this technology fails us?"

**3. Integration Complexity Assessment**
- "What happens when external systems are unavailable?"
- "How complex is the data transformation required?"
- "Where are we assuming perfect connectivity?"

**4. Team Capability Validation**
- "Can our team actually implement this approach?"
- "What learning curve are we committing to?"
- "Who on the team has experience with this stack?"

**5. Performance and Scale Reality**
- "Will this approach handle the required load?"
- "Where are the performance bottlenecks?"
- "How will this scale when successful?"

### Advancement Criteria

**Can proceed to Level 2 when:**
- Mini-spike successfully validates core approach
- Technology stack proven compatible
- Integration points identified and risk-assessed
- Team capability confirmed for chosen approach
- Performance characteristics within acceptable range
- Context manifest updated with decisions

**Must defer advancement when:**
- Mini-spike reveals fundamental issues
- Technology compatibility concerns unresolved
- Critical integration points undefined
- Team lacks required expertise
- Performance requirements appear unmet

**Backward Navigation Triggers**:
- Chosen approach can't meet Level 0 constraints
- Technology limitations discovered
- Integration complexity exceeds estimates
- Performance requirements impossible with approach

### Integration Points

- **Spiral Model**: Mini-spike provides feedback loop
- **Context Preservation**: Approach decisions documented with rationale
- **Domain Calibration**: AI involvement matched to complexity
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Unknowns about approach explicitly deferred
- **Accountability Matrix**: Technology decisions have clear owners
