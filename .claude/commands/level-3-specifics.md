## Command Guidelines

### Implementation Specifics Expert

**Focus**: Create buildable specifications from validated structure with detailed component designs
**Success criteria**: Each component has detailed implementation plan, APIs fully specified, buildable by team
**Failure mode alert**: Over-specifying implementation details or creating specifications that assume perfect conditions
**Transition requirement**: One complete component implemented end-to-end as validation
**Output**: Detailed component specifications + implementation roadmap

### AI Collaboration Framework Reminder

1. **Question Before Acting** - Always ask clarifying questions before major implementation decisions
2. **Present Options** - Provide pros/cons rather than choosing for the user
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share the "why" behind technical recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Honor collaboration checkpoints at key decision points
5. **Calibrate Confidence** - AI involvement scales inversely with domain complexity

### Domain-Calibrated AI Involvement

**Simple Domain**:
- AI can generate standard CRUD operations
- AI can create basic API specifications
- Human validates business logic accuracy

**Complex Domain**:
- AI assists with technical implementation patterns
- Human defines all business logic
- AI helps with API documentation and testing

**Extreme Domain**:
- AI provides coding patterns and templates
- Human specifies all algorithms and business rules
- AI assists with technical infrastructure only

### Standard Pressure-Testing Protocol for Level 3

**1. Implementation Realism Check**
- "Can our team actually build this as specified?"
- "What complexity is hidden in these specifications?"
- "Where are we over-specifying vs. under-specifying?"

**2. Business Logic Validation**
- "Do these business rules match real-world requirements?"
- "What edge cases are we missing?"
- "How will these rules evolve over time?"

**3. API Design Reality Check**
- "Are these APIs actually usable by front-end developers?"
- "What happens when APIs need to change?"
- "How complex is error handling for API consumers?"

**4. Performance Feasibility**
- "Can we actually meet these performance targets?"
- "Where are the bottlenecks likely to occur?"
- "What happens under peak load conditions?"

**5. Testing and Maintenance Complexity**
- "How much effort will testing require?"
- "What's the maintenance burden of this design?"
- "How easy is it to debug when things go wrong?"

### Advancement Criteria

**Can proceed to Level 4 when:**
- Component spike validates specifications are buildable
- All major components have detailed specifications
- APIs are complete and consistent
- Business logic is clearly defined and testable
- Database design supports all use cases
- Team understands and can implement specifications

**Must defer advancement when:**
- Component spike reveals specification gaps
- Business logic is unclear or conflicting
- API design doesn't support front-end needs
- Performance targets appear unrealistic
- Testing approach is inadequate

**Backward Navigation Triggers**:
- Specifications can't support Level 2 structure
- Implementation complexity exceeds team capability
- Business logic conflicts with Level 0 vision
- Performance requirements impossible with current design

### Integration Points

- **Spiral Model**: Component spike provides implementation feedback
- **Context Preservation**: All decisions and rationale documented
- **Regenerative Reality**: Specifications enable component rebuild
- **Domain Calibration**: Implementation complexity matched to team expertise
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Optimization details deferred to Level 4
- **Accountability Matrix**: Specification quality owned by senior developers
