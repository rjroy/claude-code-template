## Usage

```
/level-3-specifics <component-artifact-file>
```

**Input**: Level 2 component YAML artifact (e.g., `level-2-similarity.yml`)
**Output**: Feature YAML artifacts for the component (e.g., `level-3-similarity-feature1.yml`)

## Command Guidelines

### Context File Format Reminder

**Context File**:
  Structured document preserving critical project decisions across development phases.

**IMPORTANT**:
  Context files generated by the SAID command set are stored in YAML format (`.yml` extension), not Markdown.
  They are located in the `context/` directory.

- Follow these guidelines when generating context files.
- Context files need not be the only artifacts generated.
- Report files are in Markdown (`.md` extension). They are located in the `docs/reports/` directory.

### Implementation Specifics Expert

**Focus**: Create buildable specifications from validated structure with detailed component designs
**Success criteria**: Each component has detailed implementation plan, APIs fully specified, buildable by team
**Failure mode alert**: Over-specifying implementation details or creating specifications that assume perfect conditions
**Transition requirement**: One complete component implemented end-to-end as validation
**Output**: Detailed feature specifications + feature YAML artifacts + implementation roadmap

### AI Collaboration Framework Reminder

1. **Question Before Acting** - Always ask clarifying questions before major implementation decisions
2. **Present Options** - Provide pros/cons rather than choosing for the user
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share the "why" behind technical recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Honor collaboration checkpoints at key decision points
5. **Calibrate Confidence** - AI involvement scales inversely with domain complexity

- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Present testing/monitoring approach, discuss alternatives with user

### Feature Decomposition and Artifact Generation

**Component-to-Feature Decomposition**:
Level 3 processes ONE component at a time, decomposing it into implementable features.

**Input Processing**:
1. **Component Artifact Analysis**: Parse Level 2 component YAML artifact
2. **Component Understanding**: Extract component responsibilities, interfaces, and constraints
3. **Feature Identification**: Identify distinct features within the component
4. **Feature Validation**: Ensure features align with component boundaries and purpose

**Feature YAML Artifacts (Required)**:
For each identified feature, create a structured YAML artifact using the template:

```yaml
# Use template: context/templates/level-3-feature-artifact.yml
# Generate one artifact per feature: level-3-{component-name}-{feature-name}.yml

artifact_requirements:
  - One YAML file per feature
  - Use consistent naming: level-3-{component-name}-{feature-name}.yml
  - Reference external API specs, data models, business logic specs
  - Include traceability to parent component and Level 0 vision
  - Document feature dependencies and integration points
  - Specify detailed validation and testing requirements
```

**Feature Decomposition Process**:
1. **Component Analysis**: Analyze input component artifact for decomposition opportunities
2. **Feature Identification**: Identify 3-5 distinct features per component
3. **FEATURE VALIDATION**: Present feature boundaries and responsibilities, get user feedback
4. **Feature Specification**: Create detailed specifications for each feature
5. **ARTIFACT GENERATION**: Generate feature YAML artifacts for each feature
6. **ARTIFACT REVIEW**: Review generated artifacts with user for completeness
7. **Feature Integration**: Ensure features integrate properly within component

**Feature Classification**:
- **Core Business Logic**: Business rules, calculations, workflows
- **User Interface**: User interactions, data presentation
- **Integration**: External system communication, data synchronization
- **Data Processing**: Data transformation, validation, storage
- **Infrastructure**: Monitoring, logging, security, configuration

**External Artifact References**:
- API specifications: Create separate OpenAPI/GraphQL/Proto files per feature
- Data models: Create separate JSON Schema/SQL/Proto files per feature
- Business logic specs: Create separate YAML/JSON specifications per feature
- Workflow specs: Create separate BPMN/YAML workflow definitions per feature
- Feature YAML artifacts reference these external files

**Feature Validation Requirements**:
- Each feature has clear business value and user story
- Feature boundaries don't overlap with other features
- Feature dependencies are minimal and well-defined
- Feature specifications are buildable by the team
- Traceability to parent component is maintained

### Component Validation Spike

**Level 3 Validation Spike (Required)**:
```yaml
component_spike:
  purpose: "Implement one complete component end-to-end"
  duration: "1-2 days maximum"
  scope: "Full component with tests and integration"
  deliverables:
    - "Working component implementation"
    - "Complete API endpoints"
    - "Database integration"
    - "Test suite with good coverage"
    - "Integration with at least one other component"
```

**Spike Selection Criteria**:
- Choose most representative component
- Includes typical business logic complexity
- Requires database integration
- Has clear external interfaces
- **COLLABORATION CHECKPOINT**: Discuss which component to implement for validation

### Domain-Calibrated AI Involvement

**Simple Domain**:
- AI can generate standard CRUD operations
- AI can create basic API specifications
- Human validates business logic accuracy

**Complex Domain**:
- AI assists with technical implementation patterns
- Human defines all business logic
- AI helps with API documentation and testing

**Extreme Domain**:
- AI provides coding patterns and templates
- Human specifies all algorithms and business rules
- AI assists with technical infrastructure only

### Standard Pressure-Testing Protocol for Level 3

**1. Implementation Realism Check**
- "Can our team actually build this as specified?"
- "What complexity is hidden in these specifications?"
- "Where are we over-specifying vs. under-specifying?"

**2. Business Logic Validation**
- "Do these business rules match real-world requirements?"
- "What edge cases are we missing?"
- "How will these rules evolve over time?"

**3. API Design Reality Check**
- "Are these APIs actually usable by front-end developers?"
- "What happens when APIs need to change?"
- "How complex is error handling for API consumers?"

**4. Performance Feasibility**
- "Can we actually meet these performance targets?"
- "Where are the bottlenecks likely to occur?"
- "What happens under peak load conditions?"

**5. Testing and Maintenance Complexity**
- "How much effort will testing require?"
- "What's the maintenance burden of this design?"
- "How easy is it to debug when things go wrong?"

### Advancement Criteria

**Can proceed to Level 4 when:**
- Component spike validates specifications are buildable
- All component features have detailed specifications
- Feature YAML artifacts generated and validated for each feature
- APIs are complete and consistent
- Business logic is clearly defined and testable
- Database design supports all use cases
- Team understands and can implement specifications

**Must defer advancement when:**
- Component spike reveals specification gaps
- Business logic is unclear or conflicting
- API design doesn't support front-end needs
- Performance targets appear unrealistic
- Testing approach is inadequate

**Backward Navigation Triggers**:
- Specifications can't support Level 2 structure
- Implementation complexity exceeds team capability
- Business logic conflicts with Level 0 vision
- Performance requirements impossible with current design

### Integration Points

- **Spiral Model**: Component spike provides implementation feedback
- **Context Preservation**: All decisions and rationale documented
- **Regenerative Reality**: Specifications enable component rebuild
- **Domain Calibration**: Implementation complexity matched to team expertise
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Optimization details deferred to Level 4
- **Accountability Matrix**: Specification quality owned by senior developers
