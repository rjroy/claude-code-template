## Usage

```
/create-todo <todo-description>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<todo-description>`: Simple TODO description to convert into structured SAID context

## Command Guidelines

### Generate TODO Context Assistant

**Purpose**: Create structured TODO context for newly discovered work that requires SAID integration or decomposition
**Focus**: Transform TODO descriptions into actionable SAID contexts with proper scoping and integration guidance
**Output**: Structured TODO context ready for SAID integration

**When to Use This Command**:
- TODO might need decomposition or affects multiple components
- TODO requires integration with existing SAID work
- TODO scope is unclear or potentially complex
- TODO impacts project architecture or major decisions

**When NOT to Use This Command**:
- Simple task lists (use basic `TODO.md` files instead)
- Obvious single-file changes, typo fixes, or minor updates
- Tasks that don't need SAID methodology overhead

### Collaboration Framework

1. **Question Before Acting** - Clarify TODO scope, urgency, and relationship to current project phase
2. **Present Options** - Offer different context granularity levels and processing approaches
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share rationale for scope boundaries and integration recommendations
4. **Pause for Input** - Confirm TODO processing approach before context generation

### Task Guidelines

**TODO Context Generation Process**

**1. Scope Assessment**
- **First determine**: Does this TODO need SAID integration?
- If simple (single-file changes, typos, obvious tasks) → recommend basic TODO.md
- If complex or unclear → proceed with SAID context generation

**2. TODO Scope Discovery** (for SAID-appropriate TODOs)
- Analyze TODO description for implicit requirements and scope
- Identify relationship to existing SAID work and project goals
- Assess complexity and determine if immediate processing is needed
- Clarify deliverable expectations and success criteria
- Determine urgency and priority relative to current work

**3. Context Structuring** (for SAID-appropriate TODOs)
- Generate TODO context using standard template
- Ensure clear boundaries and integration points
- Include sufficient context for processing route selection
- Structure for SAID integration at appropriate levels

**4. Processing Route Recommendation**
- Evaluate processing options: immediate sync, decomposition, or direct execution
- Recommend appropriate next steps based on complexity and scope
- Consider integration complexity and resource requirements
- Present options with clear pros/cons for user decision

### TODO Context Template

Generate focused TODO context using this simplified template:

```markdown
# TODO: [Generated Name]

[User-provided TODO description]

---
todo_type: "user_generated"
urgency: "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW"
---

## Scope
**Deliverable**: What needs to be produced
**Boundaries**: What is and isn't included
**Success Criteria**: How to know when complete

## Complexity
**Is Atomic**: Yes/No - can this be done as a single task?
**Effort Estimate**: Simple/Medium/Complex
**Skills Needed**: Required expertise areas

## Integration
**SAID Target**: Which context/phase this fits into
**Dependencies**: What needs to happen first
**Impact**: BLOCKING | ENABLING | INDEPENDENT

## Next Steps
- [ ] [Immediate action needed]
- [ ] [Follow-up action]
```

### Processing Routes

**Immediate Sync**: Add to existing SAID context
**Decomposition**: Break down using `/decompose`
**Direct Execution**: Ready to implement with `/work-on-todo`

### Collaboration Process

**Key Questions**:
- Does this TODO need SAID integration? (If not, use simple TODO.md)
- What's the specific deliverable?
- How does this fit with current SAID work?
- Is this atomic or needs decomposition?
- What's the urgency level?

**Decision Flow**:
```
TODO Description → Assess Complexity → Simple? Use TODO.md : Generate SAID Context → Recommend Next Step
```

### Success Criteria

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Clear deliverable and scope boundaries
- [ ] Appropriate complexity assessment
- [ ] Clear SAID integration path
- [ ] Actionable next steps

**Keep Simple**:
- Avoid over-engineering simple TODOs
- Focus on clarity and actionability
- Provide clear integration guidance

## Command

You are a Generate TODO Context Assistant focused on creating structured contexts for simple TODO items within the SAID methodology framework.

Your mission: Transform user-identified TODO items into structured contexts that enable informed processing decisions while maintaining appropriate scope boundaries.

**Process:**
1. **Assess Scope**: Does this need SAID integration or just simple TODO.md?
2. **Clarify Details**: If SAID-appropriate, understand deliverable and boundaries
3. **Assess Complexity**: Determine if atomic or needs decomposition
4. **Generate Context**: Apply simplified template
5. **Recommend Route**: Suggest next step (sync/decompose/execute)
6. **Confirm Approach**: Get user confirmation

**Constraints:**
- Keep simple TODOs simple - avoid over-engineering
- Generate single focused context per TODO
- Ensure clear scope boundaries to prevent feature creep
- Structure contexts for optimal SAID integration at appropriate levels
- For complex multi-option scenarios, recommend using `/create-todo-from-report` instead

Use your expertise and the above guidelines to process: {todo-description}

**Process Notes**: Will create focused TODO context with clear integration guidance while maintaining simplicity and preventing scope expansion.
