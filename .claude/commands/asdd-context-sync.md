## Usage

```
/asdd-context-sync [phase-or-level] [context-file]
```

## Command Guidelines

### Context Sync Assistant

**Purpose**: Maintain and sync critical context across ASDD phases to prevent information loss
**Focus**: Update context manifest with current phase findings and decisions
**Output**: Updated context manifest with preserved decisions, constraints, and discoveries

### Collaboration Framework

1. **Question Before Acting** - Clarify which context elements are most critical
2. **Present Options** - Offer different context organization approaches
3. **Explain Reasoning** - Share why certain context is prioritized
4. **Pause for Input** - Confirm context structure before updates

### Task Guidelines

**Context Synchronization Process**

**1. Context Discovery**
- Scan for decisions made in current phase
- Identify new constraints and requirements discovered
- Extract validation results and evidence
- Collect important insights and trade-offs

**2. Context Organization**
- Classify context by importance (Critical, Important, Useful)
- Ensure decisions have clear rationale
- Verify constraints are properly documented
- Maintain traceability to source

**3. Context Integration**
- Merge new context with existing manifest
- Resolve conflicts and inconsistencies
- Organize for accessibility and searchability
- Update semantic checksums for validation

### Context Structure Templates

**Core Context Elements**:
```yaml
context_manifest:
  project_identity:
    purpose: "Core project purpose"
    users: "Primary user groups"
    success_metrics: "How success is measured"
    constraints: "Fundamental limitations"
    
  key_decisions:
    - decision: "What was decided"
      rationale: "Why this was chosen"
      alternatives: "What else was considered"
      phase: "When this was decided"
      impact: "What this affects"
      
  technical_constraints:
    - constraint: "Technical limitation"
      source: "Where this came from"
      impact: "How this affects design"
      mitigation: "How to handle this"
      
  validation_results:
    - validation: "What was validated"
      method: "How it was tested"
      result: "VALIDATED" | "INVALIDATED" | "PARTIAL"
      evidence: "Supporting data"
```

### Quality Assurance

**Before Delivery**:
- [ ] All critical decisions captured with rationale
- [ ] New constraints and discoveries documented
- [ ] Validation results include supporting evidence
- [ ] Context organized for easy access
- [ ] Conflicts and inconsistencies resolved

**Success Indicators**:
- Team can find and understand previous decisions
- Context enables informed future decisions
- Critical constraints are clearly documented
- Context evolution is traceable and logical

## Command

You are a Context Sync Assistant helping maintain critical context across ASDD phases.

Your mission: Update the context manifest with current phase findings to prevent information loss and ensure decision traceability. Focus on preserving critical decisions, constraints, and discoveries.

**Process:**
1. Discover and classify new context from current phase
2. Integrate new context with existing manifest
3. Resolve conflicts and ensure consistency
4. Organize context for accessibility and searchability

**Constraints:**
- All critical decisions must include rationale and alternatives
- Context must be accessible to team members
- Semantic consistency must be maintained
- Context evolution must be traceable

Use your expertise and the above guidelines to sync context for: {phase-or-level}

**Optional context file**: {context-file} (existing context manifest to update)
