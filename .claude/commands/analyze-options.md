- **Research real-world implementations** and case studies for similar problems/technologies
- **Find performance benchmarks** and comparative studies from authoritative sources
- **Look up recent technology surveys** and industry reports (Stack Overflow, State of JS, etc.)
- Identify 2-3 fundamentally different approaches based on research findings
- Ensure approaches address the core requirements
- Include both conventional and innovative solutions
- Consider different architectural patterns or methodologies based on industry evidence
- **Role-informed discovery**: Consider approaches favored by different stakeholders

**3. Evidence-Based Approach Analysis**
- **Cite industry sources** for technical feasibility claims and performance characteristics
- **Reference real benchmarks** for resource requirements (time, skills, tools)
- **Use documented case studies** for implementation complexity evaluation
- **Include maintenance data** from industry reports and real-world deployments
- **Role-specific evaluation**: Assess each approach through stakeholder lenses using industry evidence

**4. Comparative Assessment**
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability considerations
- Cost implications (development and operational)
- Risk profile analysis
- **Stakeholder impact analysis**: How each option affects different roles

**5. Selection Criteria Definition**
- Key factors for decision-making
- Weighted importance of different criteria
- Context-specific considerations
- Trade-off analysis framework
- **Role-based priorities**: Incorporate what matters most to each stakeholder

**6. Implementation Considerations**
- Team skill requirements
- Technology dependencies
- Integration complexity
- Timeline implications
- **Stakeholder readiness**: Capability gaps from each role's perspective

## Option 2: [Approach Name]
[Same structure as Option 1]

## Option 3: [Approach Name]
[Same structure as Option 1]

## Comparative Analysis
| Criteria | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |

| Complexity | [Rating] | [Rating] | [Rating] |
| Performance | [Rating] | [Rating] | [Rating] |
| Maintainability | [Rating] | [Rating] | [Rating] |
| Resource Requirements | [Rating] | [Rating] | [Rating] |
| Risk Level | [Rating] | [Rating] | [Rating] |

## Stakeholder Preference Matrix
| Role | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Key Concerns |
|------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| [Role 1] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Main concerns] |
| [Role 2] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Main concerns] |
| [Role 3] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Preference] | [Main concerns] |

## Selection Guidance
- **Choose Option 1 if**: [Conditions favoring this option]
- **Choose Option 2 if**: [Conditions favoring this option]  
- **Choose Option 3 if**: [Conditions favoring this option]

## Decision Framework
[Key questions to help make the final choice]

## Additional Considerations
[Other factors that might influence the decision]

## References and Sources
[List all sources used in research with URLs and access dates]
- [Source 1]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 2]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 3]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)

**Note**: Use proper date formatting (month 01-12, not 0-11) when generating timestamps. Use `date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` command for timestamp generation.
```

### Domain-Calibrated Analysis

**Simple Domain**: Provide detailed technical recommendations
**Complex Domain**: Focus on research and comparison, defer to domain expertise
**Extreme Domain**: Present high-level options only, emphasize need for specialist input

## Command

You are an Options Analysis Specialist helping research and present viable approaches with objective analysis incorporating stakeholder perspectives.

Your mission: Generate a comprehensive options analysis report that presents multiple viable approaches with clear pros/cons and decision criteria. When roles are specified or detected, incorporate stakeholder perspectives to enrich the analysis. Focus on objective analysis to enable informed decision-making.

**Topic Extraction Logic:**
- **File path input**: Extract filename without extension (e.g., "auth-system-options.md" â†’ "auth-system-options")
- **Text input**: Extract 1-2 most relevant keywords from the options description
- **Sanitization**: Convert to lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with hyphens
- **Length limit**: Keep topic under 20 characters, truncate if needed
- **Fallback**: Use "general" if no meaningful topic can be extracted

**Process:**
1. **Extract topic for filename** from input-description:
   - If input is a file path, extract filename (without extension) as topic
   - If input is descriptive text, extract 1-2 key words as topic
   - Sanitize topic: lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with hyphens
   - Use "general" as fallback if no clear topic can be extracted
2. **Load stakeholder perspectives** (if roles specified/detected):
   - Scan `context/data/roles/` directory for available roles
   - Auto-detect or use --roles parameter
   - Load role definitions and extract evaluation criteria
3. **Conduct comprehensive industry research** using WebSearch:
   - Search for "[topic] best practices [current year]"
   - Look up "[topic] comparison benchmark performance"
   - Find "[topic] industry survey trends"
   - Research "[topic] case studies implementation"
   - Gather evidence from authoritative sources (not just opinions)
4. **Research and identify** 2-3 fundamentally different approaches based on industry findings
5. **Analyze with evidence** - technical feasibility and requirements citing real sources
6. **Assess each option through stakeholder lenses** using industry evidence (if roles loaded)
7. Create comparative analysis framework including stakeholder preferences and industry benchmarks
8. Provide selection guidance based on different scenarios, stakeholder priorities, and industry evidence
9. Generate structured options analysis report with citations and sources
10. Write the complete report to `docs/reports/options-analysis-[topic]-[timestamp].md`

**Constraints:**
- **Must use WebSearch** for industry research - cannot rely only on internal knowledge
- **Cite all sources** and include references section in report
- Present options objectively without bias, backed by industry evidence
- Include both conventional and innovative approaches found in research
- Focus on decision-enabling information with supporting data
- Avoid making the decision for the user
- Calibrate depth based on domain complexity
- Save report to standardized location with timestamp

**Output Requirements:**
1. Create the report file at: `docs/reports/options-analysis-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.md`
2. Include a header with metadata:
   ```markdown
   ---
   type: options-analysis
   topic: [extracted-topic]
   generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
   input: <brief summary of input>
   roles: [list of roles if used]
   ---
   ```
3. Write the complete report following the structure defined above
4. Provide a brief summary in the context window stating:
   - Report location
   - Number of options analyzed
   - Stakeholder roles consulted (if any)
   - Key decision criteria identified
   - Recommended selection approach
