# Feature Implementation Decomposition Type Definition (Simple)

## Type Identity
- **Type Name**: Feature Implementation
- **Input Format**: Level 3 feature context Markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- **Output Format**: Implementation task TODO context Markdown files
- **Decomposition Focus**: Transform Level 3 specifications into atomic implementation tasks

## Input Requirements

### Expected Input Structure
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

[Feature description and business value]

---
feature_type: "BUSINESS_LOGIC | UI | INTEGRATION | DATA"
user_story: "As [user] I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
---

## What This Feature Does

**Purpose**: Clear description of the feature
**User Value**: Why users need this feature
**Success Criteria**: How to know the feature is complete

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Requirement 1: What must be built
- Requirement 2: What must be built

### Technical Requirements
- Performance: What performance is needed
- Security: What security is needed
- Testing: What testing is needed

## Integration Notes
- How this connects to other features/components
- What external systems it uses
- What data it needs
```

### Input Validation Rules
- Must have feature name and clear description
- Must have implementation requirements
- Must have success criteria defined
- Must be from Level 3 (buildable specifications)

## Decomposition Strategy

### Decomposition Rules
- Generate 4-8 implementation tasks maximum per feature
- Each task must be atomic (few hours to 2 days maximum)
- Tasks should enable some parallel execution
- Must include basic testing tasks
- Each task gets its own TODO context file

## Collaboration Checkpoints

### Required User Input Points
1. **Task Breakdown Validation**
   - **Trigger**: After feature analysis
   - **Question**: "I've identified these implementation tasks: [development, testing, deployment]. Which areas need special attention for your team?"
   - **Required**: User must confirm task breakdown approach

2. **Implementation Strategy Confirmation**
   - **Trigger**: During task specification
   - **Question**: "Here are the proposed approaches: [technical decisions]. Do these align with your existing codebase?"
   - **Required**: User must validate technical approach

3. **Testing Coverage Expectations**
   - **Trigger**: Before generating final tasks
   - **Question**: "What testing coverage should we target? What's realistic for your team?"
   - **Required**: User must define testing requirements

## Output Specification

### Output Artifacts

#### Implementation Plan Template
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Parent Feature Name]

Why the feature was broken into these specific tasks and the implementation approach.

plan_type: "feature_implementation"
source_feature: "Reference to Level 3 feature"

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Development
**Task**: Implement core business logic
**Deliverable**: Working core functionality
**Estimated Effort**: X days

### API/Interface Development
**Task**: Implement user-facing interfaces
**Deliverable**: Working APIs or UI
**Estimated Effort**: X days

### Testing
**Task**: Create tests for the feature
**Deliverable**: Test suite with good coverage
**Estimated Effort**: X days

### Integration & Deployment
**Task**: Integrate and deploy the feature
**Deliverable**: Feature working in target environment
**Estimated Effort**: X days

## Task Dependencies
- Core Development → API Development → Testing → Deployment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core functionality working
- [ ] APIs/UI working and tested
- [ ] Feature deployed and accessible
```

#### Implementation Task TODO Context Template
```markdown
# TODO: [Implementation Task Name]

Specific implementation work to be accomplished as part of the larger feature.

---
todo_type: "implementation_task"
source_feature: "Reference to parent Level 3 feature"
estimated_effort: "Realistic time estimate"
---

## Work Scope

**Primary Deliverable**: Specific code/configuration to be produced
**Success Criteria**: How to know when implementation is complete

### What Needs to Be Built
- [ ] Specific component/function 1
- [ ] Specific component/function 2
- [ ] Specific component/function 3

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Basic tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests if needed
- [ ] Manual testing checklist

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Follow project coding standards
