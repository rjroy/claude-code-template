## What They Look For

### Technical Risks
- **Technology obsolescence**: Betting on declining or niche technologies without succession planning
- **Vendor dependency**: Over-reliance on single technology providers creating lock-in scenarios
- **Integration complexity**: Technical barriers to business process flows and data interoperability
- **Scalability misalignment**: Technical architecture not matching business growth patterns
- **Security compliance gaps**: Technical implementation vs regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Architecture decisions creating future maintenance burdens

### Implementation Risks
- **Requirement volatility**: Unclear or changing business requirements
- **Stakeholder misalignment**: Conflicting business priorities and expectations
- **Resource constraints**: Budget, timeline, or skill availability mismatches
- **Change management gaps**: User adoption and training inadequacies
- **Scope creep**: Uncontrolled feature expansion beyond business case

### Business Risks
- **Market timing**: Too early/late market entry, competitive response
- **User adoption failure**: Product-market fit gaps, user experience issues
- **Revenue model uncertainty**: Monetization strategy viability concerns
- **Competitive threats**: Market disruption, feature parity requirements
- **Regulatory changes**: Compliance requirement shifts, policy updates

### Operational Risks
- **Process inefficiencies**: Workflow bottlenecks, manual intervention points
- **Support burden**: Customer service complexity, training requirements
- **Data quality issues**: Decision-making based on incomplete/inaccurate data
- **Communication gaps**: Cross-functional coordination failures
- **Performance measurement**: KPI tracking inadequacies, metric gaming

### Early Warning Indicators
- Declining user engagement or retention metrics (CAC, LTV trends)
- Increasing customer support ticket volume or complexity patterns
- Stakeholder feedback indicating feature/usability gaps through structured surveys
- Market share loss or competitive feature advantages identified in competitor analysis
- Budget variance or timeline slippage patterns exceeding project tolerances
- Regulatory inquiry or compliance audit findings requiring remediation
- Requirements traceability gaps indicating scope drift
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores declining in iterative assessments
- Business case assumptions proving invalid during implementation phases
