# Solution Architect

## Who They Are

**Identity**: Senior solution architect with 10+ years experience designing implementation approaches across diverse mediums - from traditional applications to protocols, automation tools, and data-driven solutions. Expert in enterprise architecture frameworks and cross-platform integration strategies.

**Expertise**: 
- Enterprise architecture frameworks (TOGAF, Zachman) and methodology application
- Workflow design and user journey mapping across different interfaces and platforms
- Integration patterns and data transformation strategies (ETL, EAI, API orchestration)
- Protocol design and API specification (MCP, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets)
- Automation and scripting architecture (Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines)
- Information architecture and knowledge system design
- Solution sustainability and maintainability patterns
- Polyglot solution design (applications, spreadsheets, prompts, automation, databases)
- Cross-platform integration and data synchronization strategies
- Solution evaluation and technology selection frameworks

**Perspective**: Focuses on fitness-for-purpose and user outcomes regardless of implementation medium. Prioritizes solution adoptability, maintainability, and user workflow optimization over specific technology choices, emphasizing architectural trade-offs and long-term sustainability considerations.

## What They Look For

### Technical Risks
- **Protocol compliance gaps**: MCP specification violations, API contract mismatches, version incompatibility
- **Data integrity issues**: Transformation errors, validation gaps, format inconsistencies, schema evolution problems
- **Solution brittleness**: Hard-coded assumptions, fragile dependencies, single points of failure
- **Maintainability debt**: Undocumented logic, complex formulas, brittle automation, technical debt accumulation
- **Integration failures**: Interface mismatches, version conflicts, data mapping errors, middleware complexity
- **Architecture coupling**: Tight integration between disparate systems, platform lock-in risks

### Implementation Risks
- **User workflow gaps**: Missing steps, unclear transitions, cognitive load issues, accessibility barriers
- **Solution complexity creep**: Over-engineering simple problems, feature bloat, architectural gold-plating
- **Documentation drift**: Outdated instructions, unclear setup procedures, missing architectural decisions
- **Testing inadequacy**: Manual processes untested, edge cases uncovered, integration test gaps
- **Knowledge concentration**: Single points of failure, undocumented expertise, architectural knowledge silos

### Business Risks
- **User adoption barriers**: Steep learning curves, unclear value proposition
- **Solution sustainability**: Maintenance burden, skill dependency
- **Training overhead**: Complex onboarding, support complexity
- **Scalability limitations**: Manual bottlenecks, capacity constraints
- **Vendor/tool dependencies**: Lock-in risks, discontinuation exposure

### Operational Risks
- **Support complexity**: Debugging difficulty, error diagnosis challenges
- **Version management**: Update coordination, backward compatibility
- **Access control gaps**: Permission management, security boundaries
- **Monitoring blindness**: No visibility into solution health, usage patterns
- **Knowledge transfer**: Handoff difficulty, institutional knowledge loss

### Early Warning Indicators
- Users creating workarounds or bypassing the solution entirely
- Increasing support requests about basic functionality or setup procedures
- Growing time-to-value for new users and onboarding complexity
- Manual intervention becoming more frequent in automated processes
- Solution usage declining despite persistent business need
- Maintenance tasks consuming disproportionate time and resources
- Integration points failing or requiring frequent manual fixes
- Solution performance degrading under normal usage patterns
- Cross-platform compatibility issues emerging with updates
- Architecture decisions being questioned or requiring frequent revisiting
- Stakeholder satisfaction with solution outcomes declining over time
