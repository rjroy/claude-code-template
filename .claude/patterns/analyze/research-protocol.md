# Research Protocol Patterns

## Industry Research Requirements

### Evidence-Based Analysis Strategy
- **Must use WebSearch** for industry research - cannot rely only on internal knowledge
- **Cite all sources** and include references section in report
- Research current industry best practices, standards, and trends
- Find performance benchmarks and comparative studies from authoritative sources
- Look up recent technology surveys and industry reports (Stack Overflow, State of JS, etc.)

### Research Targets
- Real-world implementations and case studies for similar problems
- Performance benchmarks and comparative studies
- Technology surveys and industry reports
- Best practices from authoritative sources
- Current trends and emerging approaches

### Approach Identification
- Identify 2-3 fundamentally different approaches based on research findings
- Ensure approaches address core requirements
- Include both conventional and innovative solutions
- Consider different architectural patterns or methodologies based on industry evidence

## Evidence-Based Evaluation

### Technical Assessment
- **Cite industry sources** for technical feasibility claims and performance characteristics
- **Reference real benchmarks** for resource requirements (time, skills, tools)
- **Use documented case studies** for implementation complexity evaluation
- **Include maintenance data** from industry reports and real-world deployments

### Validation Standards
- All claims must be backed by credible sources
- Include URLs and access dates for references
- Distinguish between opinion and verified data
- Present balanced view without bias toward any option

## Source Citation Format

### References Section Template
```markdown
## References and Sources
[List all sources used in research with URLs and access dates]
- [Source 1]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 2]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 3]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
```

## Specialized Research Types

### Problem Validation Research Framework

#### Core Problem Questions
- "What specific problem does this solve for whom?"
- "How do users currently handle this problem?"
- "What makes the current solution inadequate?"
- "What would success look like from the user's perspective?"

#### Current State Analysis
- How users currently handle this
- Pain points and limitations
- Workarounds being used
- Cost of current approach

#### User Impact Assessment
- Primary user groups affected
- User constraints and contexts
- User success criteria
- Evidence of user need

#### Problem Validation Criteria
- Evidence this is a real problem
- User validation data/feedback
- Market indicators (if applicable)
- Consequences of not solving

#### Validation Questions
- "Is this solving a real problem or a perceived problem?"
- "Do the identified users actually want this solved?"
- "What evidence do we have that this is worth solving?"
- "What happens if this problem remains unsolved?"
- "What technical constraints make this problem complex?"
- "What architectural requirements emerge from this problem?"
- "What system integration challenges does this problem present?"
- "What performance, security, or scale considerations are inherent to this problem?"

#### Scope Definition
- What's included in problem scope
- What's explicitly excluded
- Potential scope creep areas
- Related problems not being addressed

#### Business Context Integration
- Business impact assessment
- Strategic alignment score
- Resource investment justification
- Timing considerations

#### Validation Sources
- User research reports
- Market studies
- Competitive analysis
- Industry pain point documentation
- User feedback and testimonials

### Risk Assessment Research Framework

#### Risk Discovery Methods
- **Assumption extraction**: Identify implicit and explicit assumptions
- **Stress testing scenarios**: Test assumptions under extreme conditions
- **Role-specific risk patterns**: Apply expertise-based risk identification
- **Cross-role synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple perspectives
- **Emergent risk detection**: Identify risks from role interactions

#### Risk Classification
- **Category**: Technical/Implementation/Integration/Business/Operational
- **Likelihood**: Low/Medium/High with justification
- **Impact**: Low/Medium/High with consequences
- **Root Cause**: Why this risk exists

#### Risk Prioritization
- Risk matrix plotting (likelihood Ã— impact)
- Critical path impact assessment
- Cascade risk identification
- Timeline sensitivity analysis

#### Mitigation Strategy Framework
- **Prevention**: How to reduce likelihood
- **Impact Reduction**: How to minimize consequences
- **Contingency**: What to do if it happens
- **Risk Transfer**: Options for shifting risk

#### Validation Methods
- **Assumption validation**: Methods to test critical assumptions
- **Early warning indicators**: Signals to watch for
- **Risk trigger identification**: Specific activation conditions
- **Monitoring mechanisms**: Ongoing assessment methods

#### Risk Interconnection Analysis
- How risks might amplify each other
- Sequential failure patterns
- Common mode failures
- System-wide vulnerabilities

#### Monitoring and Response
- **Review Frequency**: When to reassess risks
- **Key Indicators**: Metrics to track
- **Escalation Triggers**: When to take action
- **Responsibility Matrix**: Who monitors what

#### Contingency Planning
- **Resources needed**: For risk response
