# Action Planning Patterns

## Next Steps Document Template

### Standard Structure
```markdown
## Next Steps for [Phase/Context]

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] **Action item description** (Priority: High/Medium/Low, Timeline: estimate)
  - Prerequisites: list essential dependencies
  - Success criteria: how to know it's done
  - Owner: who is responsible (if known)

### Transition Assessment
- **Current Phase**: Phase name and completion status
- **Phase Completion Status**: Assess completion status with unresolved issues
- **Recommended Next Phase**: What to do next
- **Readiness**: Ready/Blocked/Needs validation
- **Key Blockers**: Critical issues preventing progress (if any)
- **Prerequisites for Next Phase**: Essential dependencies that must be met first

### Key Risks
- **Risk description**: Basic mitigation approach
- **Risk description**: Basic mitigation approach

### Context Summary
- **Completed**: Major accomplishments from current phase
- **Lessons Learned**: Key insights to carry forward
- **Decisions Made**: Critical choices that affect next steps
```

## Action Item Guidelines

### Specificity Requirements
- Focus on specific, actionable tasks
- Avoid vague or aspirational statements
- Include measurable outcomes
- Specify concrete deliverables

### Priority Framework
- **High**: Critical path items, blockers for other work
- **Medium**: Important but not immediately blocking
- **Low**: Nice-to-have or can be deferred

### Timeline Estimation
- Use simple time units (hours, days, weeks)
- Focus on effort estimates, not calendar dates
- Account for dependencies and prerequisites
- Be realistic about complexity

## Prerequisites Management

### Dependency Types
- **Technical**: Systems, tools, or implementations needed
- **Decision**: Choices or approvals required
- **Resource**: People, time, or budget availability
- **Knowledge**: Information, research, or expertise needed

### Validation Criteria
- All prerequisites must have clear validation criteria
- Dependencies should be actionable by someone
- Critical path dependencies identified
- Parallel work opportunities noted

## Risk Integration

### Risk-Aware Planning
- Identify risks that could derail transition
- Include mitigation actions in immediate steps
- Consider alternative approaches for high-risk items
- Plan monitoring and early warning systems

### Contingency Planning
- Alternative paths when primary approach blocked
- Escalation procedures for critical issues
- Resource backup plans
- Timeline adjustment strategies

## Transition Scenarios

### Current State Analysis Framework

#### Phase Completion Assessment
- Assess completion status of current phase
- Identify unresolved issues and their blocking impact
- Evaluate outcomes and lessons learned
- Review critical decisions and constraints

#### Status Evaluation Questions
- What has been completed successfully?
- What remains unfinished or blocked?
- What critical decisions were made?
- What constraints or limitations were discovered?
- What lessons learned should inform next steps?

### Next Phase Planning

#### Phase Transition Logic
- Determine appropriate next phase based on outcomes
- Identify prerequisites and blocking issues
- Assess resource and capability needs
- Define success criteria for transition

#### Readiness Assessment Framework
- **Ready**: All prerequisites met, can proceed immediately
- **Blocked**: Critical blockers prevent progress
- **Needs Validation**: Requires user input or verification before proceeding

### Transition Risk Categories
- **Incomplete Prerequisites**: Missing dependencies for next phase
- **Resource Constraints**: Lack of time, skills, or tools
- **Technical Blockers**: Implementation or integration challenges
- **Decision Dependencies**: Waiting for choices or approvals

### Transition Mitigation Strategies
- **Prevention**: Actions to reduce likelihood of transition issues
- **Contingency**: Alternative approaches if blockers occur
- **Monitoring**: How to detect transition problems early
- **Escalation**: When and how to seek help during transitions

## Quality Assurance

### Completeness Checklist
- All critical next steps identified
- Dependencies clearly mapped
- Risk mitigation included
- Success criteria defined
- Realistic timelines estimated

### Actionability Test
- Can someone start working immediately?
- Are prerequisites clearly defined?
- Is success measurable?
- Are risks adequately addressed?
