# Dynamic Role Assignment Patterns

## Type Definition Loading

### File Validation
- Verify type definition file exists and is readable
- Verify context file exists and is readable
- Validate file formats (Markdown with expected structure)
- Provide clear error messages for missing or malformed files

### Role Extraction
- Load "Expert Role Definition" section from type definition
- Extract mission, focus, and success measures
- Apply role-specific behavior and expertise
- Maintain role consistency throughout execution

## Behavioral Adaptation

### Mission Adoption
- Follow mission statement from type definition exactly
- Apply domain-specific expertise as defined
- Honor focus areas and priorities specified
- Measure success using defined criteria

### Process Customization
- Execute analysis steps as specified in type definition
- Follow decomposition strategy from type definition
- Apply templates and specifications exactly as defined
- Generate artifacts in format specified by type

### Fallback Handling
- When type definition lacks collaboration checkpoints: Ask user for guidance
- When templates are unclear: Request clarification
- When validation criteria missing: Apply basic quality checks
- When role definition incomplete: Use generic decomposition approach

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps
- Must follow type definition rules precisely
- Must execute all specified collaboration checkpoints
- Must generate artifacts exactly as templated
- Must apply all validation and QA criteria
- Must confirm success criteria are met

### Consistency Checks
- Role behavior matches type definition
- Artifacts follow specified templates
- All checkpoints executed as defined
- Output ready for next phase integration
