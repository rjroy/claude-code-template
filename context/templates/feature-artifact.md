# Level 3 Feature Artifact Template

This template structures feature specifications from Level 3 Implementation Specifics. Features are decomposed from Level 2 components. External artifacts (APIs, data models, business logic specs) are referenced, not embedded.

## Git-Hook Testing Strategy

### Pre-Commit Hooks
Fast, focused validation that runs before each commit:

```yaml
pre_commit_hooks:
  - hook_name: "HookName (e.g., lint-check, format-check)"
    scope: "changed_files/affected_files/all_files"
    languages: ["ProjectSpecificLanguages"]
    failure_mode: "block_commit/warn/skip"
    bypass_allowed: true  # Whether developers can bypass with --no-verify
    estimated_duration: "< N seconds/minutes"
    rationale: "Why this hook is needed at commit time"
```

### Pre-Push Hooks
Moderate duration, broader validation that runs before pushing:

```yaml
pre_push_hooks:
  - hook_name: "HookName (e.g., unit-tests, security-scan)"
    scope: "affected_features/changed_components/full_suite"
    test_selection: "smart_selection/all_tests/critical_path"
    failure_mode: "block_push/warn/conditional"
    max_duration: "N minutes maximum"
    fallback_behavior: "What happens if hook fails/times out"
    rationale: "Why this validation is needed before push"
```

### CI/CD Hooks
Comprehensive validation in continuous integration:

```yaml
ci_cd_hooks:
  - hook_name: "HookName (e.g., integration-tests, deployment-gate)"
    trigger: "pull_request/merge/release/scheduled"
    required_coverage: "N% code coverage requirement"
    performance_gates: ["Specific performance requirements"]
    security_scans: ["Types of security validation"]
    quality_gates: ["Code quality requirements"]
    deployment_gates: ["What must pass before deployment"]
    rationale: "Why this comprehensive validation is needed"
```

### Hook Management Strategy
