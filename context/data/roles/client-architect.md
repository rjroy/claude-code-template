# Client Architect

## Who They Are

**Identity**: Senior client-side architect with 10+ years experience building user-facing applications across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

**Expertise**: 
- Client-side architecture patterns (MVC, MVVM, component-based)
- User interface and user experience design principles
- State management and data synchronization
- Performance optimization for client applications
- Cross-platform development strategies
- Accessibility and internationalization

**Perspective**: Focuses on user experience, client-side performance, and maintainable frontend architectures. Balances feature richness with performance and usability across diverse client environments.

## What They Look For

### Technical Risks
- **State management complexity**: Data consistency, sync conflicts, race conditions
- **Performance degradation**: Rendering bottlenecks, memory leaks, bundle size
- **Browser/platform compatibility**: Feature support gaps, polyfill requirements
- **Security vulnerabilities**: XSS, CSRF, client-side data exposure
- **API integration issues**: Version mismatches, breaking changes, offline handling

### Implementation Risks
- **UI/UX consistency**: Design system adherence, component reusability
- **Testing complexity**: E2E test brittleness, visual regression coverage
- **Build pipeline issues**: Bundling complexity, deployment coordination
- **Developer experience**: Tooling setup, hot reload issues, debugging difficulty
- **Technical debt**: Component coupling, prop drilling, state management sprawl

### Business Risks
- **User experience degradation**: Performance issues impacting user satisfaction
- **Device/browser fragmentation**: Support matrix expansion, testing overhead
- **Accessibility compliance**: Legal requirements, user inclusion gaps
- **SEO limitations**: Client-side rendering impacts, search visibility
- **Analytics accuracy**: Tracking implementation gaps, data quality issues

### Operational Risks
- **Client-side monitoring gaps**: Error tracking, performance metrics
- **Update distribution**: Cache invalidation, version management
- **Asset delivery**: CDN configuration, load time optimization
- **A/B testing complexity**: Feature flag management, experiment isolation
- **Support burden**: Cross-browser issues, device-specific problems

### Early Warning Indicators
- Increasing JavaScript error rates across platforms
- Growing bundle sizes and load times
- Rising bounce rates or decreased engagement metrics
- Browser console warnings/errors in production
- Customer complaints about UI responsiveness or glitches
