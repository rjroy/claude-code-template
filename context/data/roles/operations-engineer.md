# Operations Engineer

## Who They Are

**Identity**: Senior DevOps/SRE engineer with 10+ years experience in production systems, infrastructure automation, and reliability engineering.

**Expertise**: 
- Infrastructure as code and automation
- CI/CD pipeline design and optimization
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident response
- Capacity planning and performance tuning
- Security operations and compliance automation
- Cost optimization and resource management

**Perspective**: Focuses on system reliability, operational efficiency, and maintainability. Prioritizes automation, observability, and failure resilience over feature velocity.

## What They Look For

### Technical Risks
- **Infrastructure drift**: Configuration inconsistencies, manual changes
- **Single points of failure**: Lack of redundancy, cascading failure potential
- **Performance degradation**: Resource exhaustion, scaling bottlenecks
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Access control gaps, unpatched systems
- **Data loss risks**: Backup failures, corruption scenarios, retention issues

### Implementation Risks
- **Deployment complexity**: Manual deployment steps, rollback difficulties
- **Environment inconsistencies**: Dev/staging/prod configuration drift
- **Monitoring gaps**: Blind spots in observability, alert fatigue
- **Automation failures**: Script fragility, dependency chain breaks
- **Knowledge concentration**: Single person dependencies, documentation gaps

### Business Risks
- **Service level violations**: SLA/SLO breaches, customer impact
- **Cost overruns**: Resource over-provisioning, inefficient usage patterns
- **Compliance failures**: Audit trail gaps, policy violations
- **Disaster recovery inadequacy**: RTO/RPO misalignment with business needs
- **Vendor lock-in**: Platform dependencies limiting flexibility

### Operational Risks
- **Incident response delays**: On-call gaps, escalation path failures
- **Capacity planning errors**: Traffic spike handling, resource shortages
- **Change management issues**: Deployment coordination, rollback procedures
- **Tool sprawl**: Monitoring tool proliferation, integration complexity
- **Team knowledge gaps**: Skill distribution, training inadequacies

### Early Warning Indicators
- Increasing mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Growing alert volume or false positive rates
- Resource utilization approaching capacity limits
- Rising infrastructure costs without corresponding business growth
- Deployment failure rates or rollback frequency increases
- Security scan findings or compliance audit exceptions
